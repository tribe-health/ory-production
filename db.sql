This fascinating finding is consistent across a very wide range of highly successful individuals, including leaders, doctors, coaches, professional athletes, teachers, students, and many others.\\n\\nStanford Professor Carol Dweck used the terms \\"fixed mindset\\" and \\"growth mindset\\" to distinguish two very different approaches (or mindsets) to individual challenge and performance, as described in her book, [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=mindset&qid=1551565939&s=gateway&sr=8-2) Those with a **fixed mindset** believe that each of us is born with a certain amount of intelligence, athletic ability, talent, and so on, and that there is little they can do to change it. When they encounter something that they cannot do well, such as math, they interpret this as evidence that they are not good at math. From then on, they tend to avoid math as best they can, because time spent struggling with math is a waste of time, leads to failure, and increases the risk of being exposed as unintelligent or incompetent. From their perspective, this is pointless, because they are not good at math and cannot become good at math. The same mindset can happen across any activity or skill, such as softball, listening, drawing, understanding technology, or remembering names.\\n\\nIn sharp contrast, people with a **growth mindset** believe that any skills or abilities can be learned, developed, and improved through learning and practice. In their view, no one is born playing basketball well or doing math perfectly. Instead, these are skills to be learned and problems to be solved. And while they don't have a deep-seated desire to appear incompetent, they are much more interested in learning how to speak Spanish, for instance, than they are in protecting themselves against looking foolish if their Spanish grammar is not perfect. People with a growth mindset think of errors as being a necessary part of working their way through to mastering a skill. And they won't let fear of making a mistake or doing a poor job stand in the way of figuring out how to do something difficult.\\n\\nMindsets start early in life. In her mindset research with young children, Dr. Dweck noticed the difference in the way children responded to the question, \\"When do you feel smart?\\". Some children responded, \\"When something is easy for me, but other people can't do it\\" or \\"When I finish something fast and it's perfect.\\" Other children answered, \\"When it's really hard, and I can do something I couldn't do before\\" and \\"When I work on something a long time and I start to figure it out.\\" Can you identify which answers came from children with a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset? The last two responses reflected a growth mindset. These responses demonstrated a natural attraction to the challenge of becoming better, and that being \\"smart\\" was an active process.", "title": "Mindset for Success ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:04:00.143958+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:48:12.481789+00	\N	f

In the examples below, you'll hear how people identified the path or runway for their goal, sought opportunities to grow by failing on purpose, and used setbacks as motivation.\\n\\nIn her book, Dr. Dweck includes a passage from a future professional soccer player: \\"All my life I've been playing up, meaning I've challenged myself with players older, bigger, more skillful, more experienced, in short, better than me. Each day I attempted to play up to their level, and I was improving faster than I ever dreamed possible.\\" This player, Mia Hamm, grew up to become the dominant female soccer player of her era. Time and time again she competed against better players and likely was outrun and outperformed time and time again. But instead of viewing these experiences as evidence that she wasn't good enough, she viewed them as opportunities to improve, refine, strengthen, and develop her soccer skills.\\n\\nMany years ago, there was a professional baseball player who was not a natural. He was not that good of a hitter, and he was highly inconsistent. But, he also loved to practice. Dr. Dweck writes: \\"When he joined the Boston Red Sox, the veterans resented him for wanting to take batting practice every day. He wasn't just a rookie; he was a rookie pitcher. Who did he think he was?\\" One of his teammates argued that being a pitcher helped because he could experiment at the plate and no one cared if he struck out or looked bad. If he missed, it didn't matter. As time went on, he learned more and more about swinging, and how to connect the bat with the ball. Over six years, he batted .354 and averaged 50 home runs a year. His name was Babe Ruth, and that teammate who saw Ruth's growth mindset was Ty Cobb. For Ruth, effort ignited ability.\\n\\nA very important concept emerges from the ways that people view performance and struggle. People with a growth mindset view failures, poor performance, and setbacks as informative. **Growth mindset promotes the practice, striving, and steady, focused effort to become good, smart, and talented.** For others, displaying effort or losing means that you're not very good. Getting rejected, trying unsuccessfully, and negative feedback become things you want to avoid because they make you feel bad or they're embarrassing. Unfortunately, the fixed mindset encourages you to avoid challenges. A growth mindset encourages effort, risk-taking, mistake-making, and persistence because, in the growth mindset, this is exactly how we get better at doing anything.", "title": "Famous Mindset Examples", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:05:04.170515+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:48:26.588138+00	\N	f

Understanding your body’s response to stressors can help you make sense of some of the unusual physical and emotional responses you may experience in difficult situations.\\n\\nThe stress response involves biological and psychological reactions that occur when a threat is perceived, such as in a physically dangerous situation. Our bodies are hard-wired to react instantly to get us ready to protect ourselves, either by fighting against the threat, or running away from the threat – you may have heard this stress response described as the “Fight or Flight” system. As **Illustration A** below shows, many parts of the body are controlled by two different branches of our nervous system. The _Parasympathetic_ branch is active when things are going normally and we are generally safe. The main function of the Parasympathetic branch is “rest and digest” – it keeps our heart rate and breathing rate slower, to conserve energy, and activates our digestive system, in order to store up energy.\\n\\nThe _Sympathetic_ branch works in the other direction: when a threat is perceived, it instantly activates the stress response, causing many physical and emotional changes to occur at once. **Illustration B** shows some of the numerous physical responses that occur when the stress response is activated.  A part of the brain called the hypothalamus sends signals that affect multiple areas of the body. Another part of the brain, the amygdala, is also activated, and this causes us to feel intense fear or anger, or sometimes a combination of the two. The digestive system is immediately turned off, causing us to feel dry mouth (because salivary glands are switched off), butterflies in the stomach, and sometimes abdominal pain. Digestive system activity is switched off because the Sympathetic branch redirects blood flow away from the stomach to the large muscles – the legs and arms – so that we have plenty of blood in them to run or fight, or both. It also signals the liver to release stored glucose (blood sugar) into the blood stream, as fuel to cope with the emergency. Nerve signals to the adrenal gland cause it to pump adrenaline into the blood stream to increase the overall activation of the body. For many people this can cause physical trembling in the hands, legs, or entire body. It can affect the facial muscles as well, so that the voice may shake when speaking.\\n\\nAlthough the overall purpose of the stress response is to preserve safety by helping us run away or fight off an attack, there are at least three ways that this reaction can cause problems for first responders.\\n\\n**Stress Response Illustration A (Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Nervous System Responses)**\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/CORDICO_Stress_Response_Illustration_12.jpg)\\n\\n**Stress Response Illustration B (The Activation of the Stress System)**\\n\\n**![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/CORDICO_Stress_Response_Illustration_21.jpg)**", "title": "Overview of the Stress Response", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 19:56:40.354095+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:10:28.21603+00	\N	f

While many strategies for promoting correctional officer and correctional staff wellness involve the safe and effective use of physical equipment in addition to policies, procedures, and protocol aimed at reducing risks of physical injury, this module is focused upon the importance of emotional wellness and well-being for correctional officers and correctional staff.\\n\\nCorrectional officers and correctional staff are exposed to a myriad of stressors as they carry out complex tasks and challenging assignments in the face of demands that can be extreme in nature. When required to absorb work-related stressors quickly, or without time to emotionally decompress, officers and staff can be faced with the distinct challenge of setting aside or compartmentalizing one stressful experience as they address other more urgent matters. If repeated again and again, this can reinforce a process of not addressing the emotional aspects of stressful events in a direct manner, while also increasing the cumulative demands placed upon an officer or staff over time.\\n\\nIn addition to the dangers and stressors inherent in the nature of correctional work, correctional officers and correctional staff must also navigate the challenges of increasing departmental politics, interpersonal relationships, financial stressors, and all of the other routine demands of life. On top of all of this, correctional officers and correctional staff can be faced with traumatic events in the course of their work that, depending upon a variety of factors, carry the potential to magnify the stress response and disrupt coping, thus undermining wellness and lessening the ability to effectively manage future demands. \\n\\nFortunately, stress is a function of not only environmental demands, but also one’s ability to deal with those demands, and there are many available tools, resources, and best practices to help promote emotional wellness and effectively manage stress. Perhaps the most important steps are acknowledging that emotional wellness must be prioritized, supporting programs for bolstering emotional wellness, and promoting a law enforcement culture that recognizes, encourages, and reinforces the utilization of such important resources. \\n\\nThe Cordico Wellness Resources provide you with access to modules for information, support, and guidance on topics including Stress Management, Work-Life Balance, Emotional Health, and Resilience Development.

For a person to receive a diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be chronic or long-lasting, impair the person's functioning, and cause the person to fall behind normal development for his or her age. The doctor will also ensure that any ADHD symptoms are not due to another medical or psychiatric condition. Most children with ADHD receive a diagnosis during the elementary school years. For an adolescent or adult to receive a diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms need to have been present prior to age 12.\\n\\nADHD symptoms can appear as early as between the ages of 3 and 6 and can continue through adolescence and adulthood. Symptoms of ADHD can be mistaken for emotional or disciplinary problems or missed entirely in quiet, well-behaved children, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Adults with undiagnosed ADHD may have a history of poor academic performance, problems at work, or difficult or failed relationships. \\n\\nADHD symptoms can change over time as a person ages. In young children with ADHD, hyperactivity-impulsivity is the most predominant symptom. As a child reaches elementary school, the symptom of inattention may become more prominent and cause the child to struggle academically. In adolescence, hyperactivity seems to lessen and may show more often as feelings of restlessness or fidgeting, but inattention and impulsivity may remain.

The relatively minor effort involved in living within your means, making a budget and sticking with it, and paying off credit cards every month will repay itself many times over in avoiding the distress and distraction that go along with constant worrying about going deeper into debt, or not having enough savings to cover expenses. One nice feature of financial fitness is that after you have set up your budget and plan for savings, relatively little time is required to maintain it. You begin to follow your budget plan, and it becomes a habit. You set up an automatic debit plan to regularly put money in savings and investments, and it works in the background, without any effort on your part. If you haven’t already done so, block out an hour or so on your days off to first set up your budget and make a plan to keep your credit cards paid off each month. Then block off 30 minutes or an hour each week until you have worked through the remaining steps, including setting up an investment account with automatic contributions, making sure you have adequate insurance. Once all is set up, it will take very little time to follow and maintain.\\n\\nImagine the difference in family relationships for correctional officer and correctional staff who follows these guidelines, compared to an officer or staff who overspends, has high credit card debt, and has to worry each month about whether the bills can be covered. Financial fitness affects family fitness – by getting a grip on budgeting and savings, you can promote less stress and greater harmony at home.\\n\\nAnd this extends to your physical health as well. Avoiding the stress of worrying about bills and debt has benefits including lower blood pressure, improved immune functioning, reduced anxiety, and enhanced mood. It will also free you mentally to give your full attention to staying effective and safe while on duty. Maintaining good financial fitness will go a long way towards helping to keep you physically and mentally fit throughout your career.", "title": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 13:27:41.017344+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 13:27:41.017344+00	\N	f

For example, if you develop tendonitis while training for a 10k, you may decide that you're just not meant to be a runner. With a growth mindset, you can recognize that tendonitis means you may have over-trained at first, or that you need to change your stride, or try a different shoe. In the growth mindset, the attitude is that running into problems just means you need to spend some time looking for solutions. After asking questions of experienced runners, experimenting a little with distance, pace, or running form, the new runner with a growth mindset will be back to training, and soon will be successfully completing the 10k race.\\n\\nIf you haven't been communicating well with your partner for some time, don't expect change overnight or say, \\"We'll never understand each other.\\" If something is difficult at first, you have an opportunity to learn from your mistakes, and to ask for help from mentors, friends, or a counselor. By setting aside self-critical thoughts about your abilities or a defensive attitude, and ignoring the fears that arise, you can free up your mind to focus completely on the challenge: Look at it from different angles; pick it apart until you understand different parts of the issue; focus more on solutions; expect that you and others won't be perfect, and accept obstacles as opportunities to strengthen and improve.\\n\\nWhat are your performance expectations for a rookie basketball player who goes up against a three-time MVP? Are you more impressed if he complains to the ref and gives up or if you can see him making adjustments and learning from experience? By welcoming mistakes, failures, and setbacks as signs that you are learning, growing, and achieving, you can avoid feeling discouraged when these do occur. This frees you to persist at achieving your goal. Also, this will allow you to recognize when you are on track to meeting your goal, and notice when you may have slipped. Of course, if you do slip, remember to practice the \\"growth mindset\\", and remind yourself to learn from why you slipped, and get back to working on the goal.", "title": "Goal Six: Expect Mistakes and Failures as Part of the Process", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:23:48.625356+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:50:49.448567+00	\N	f

Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. \\n\\n**Medication**\\n\\nFor many people, ADHD medications reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and learn. Medication also may improve physical coordination. Sometimes several different medications or dosages must be tried before finding the right one that works for a particular person. Anyone taking medications must be monitored closely and carefully by their prescribing doctor.\\n\\n**Stimulants**\\n\\nThe most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a stimulant. Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works because it increases the brain chemicals dopamine and epinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention. Under medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe. However, there are risks and side effects, especially when misused or taken in excess of the prescribed dose. For example, stimulants can raise blood pressure and heart rate and increase anxiety. Therefore, a person with other health problems, including high blood pressure, seizures, heart disease, glaucoma, liver or kidney disease, or an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor before taking a stimulant. \\n\\n**Talk with a doctor if you see any of these side effects while taking stimulants:**\\n\\n*   Decreased appetite\\n*   Sleep problems\\n*   Tics (sudden, repetitive movements or sounds)\\n*   Personality changes\\n*   Increased anxiety and irritability\\n*   Stomachaches\\n*   Headaches\\n\\n**Non-stimulants**\\n\\nA few other ADHD medications are non-stimulants. These medications take longer to start working than stimulants, but can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. Doctors may prescribe a non-stimulant: when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants; when a stimulant was not effective; or in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness.\\n\\nAlthough not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of ADHD, some antidepressants are sometimes used alone or in combination with a stimulant to treat ADHD. Antidepressants may help all of the symptoms of ADHD and can be prescribed if a patient has bothersome side effects from stimulants. Antidepressants can be helpful in combination with stimulants if a patient also has another condition, such as an anxiety disorder, depression, or another mood disorder.\\n\\nDoctors and patients can work together to find the best medication, dose, or medication combination. Learn the basics about stimulants and other mental health medications on the NIMH Mental Health Medications webpage and check the FDA website, for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. \\n\\n**Psychotherapy**\\n\\nAdding psychotherapy to treat ADHD can help patients and their families to better cope with everyday problems. Behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help a person change his or her behavior. It might involve practical assistance, such as help organizing tasks or completing schoolwork, or working through emotionally difficult events.\\n\\nBehavioral therapy also teaches a person how to:\\n\\n*   Monitor his or her own behavior \\n*   Give oneself praise or rewards for acting in a desired way, such as controlling anger or thinking before acting\\n\\nParents, teachers, and family members also can give positive or negative feedback for certain behaviors and help establish clear rules, chore lists, and other structured routines to help a person control his or her behavior. Therapists may also teach children social skills, such as how to wait their turn, share toys, ask for help, or respond to teasing.

Some examples of positive interactions include nonjudgmental listening, showing genuine interest in one another, validating one another's perspectives, and expressions that convey acceptance, empathy, fondness, admiration, affection, or gratitude.\\n\\nOne critical takeaway from Dr. Gottman's research is that negative interactions have a large impact on relationships, so much so that 5 positive interactions are required to balance out every 1 negative interaction. This is not to say that conflict should be avoided, as the majority of marriages will encounter significant conflict at times. Rather, conflict needs to be managed effectively in order for most relationships to remain stable and successful over the years.\\n\\n**Below you'll find information and helpful strategies for helping to enhance relationship success.** These strategies can be particularly helpful when dealing with relationship conflict, and improving your ratio of positive to negative interactions.

Approximately 7.2 percent or 17 million adults in the United States ages 18 and older had an AUD in 2012. This includes 11.2 million men and 5.7 million women. Adolescents can be diagnosed with an AUD as well, and in 2012, an estimated 855,000 adolescents ages 12-17 had an AUD. \\n\\nTo be diagnosed with an AUD, individuals must meet certain criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Under DSM–5, the current version of the DSM, anyone meeting any two of the 11 criteria during the same 12-month period receives a diagnosis of AUD. The severity of an AUD – mild, moderate, or severe – is based on the number of criteria met.\\n\\nTo assess whether you or a loved one may have an AUD, here are some questions to ask. In the past year, have you: \\n\\n*   Had times when you ended up drinking more, or longer than you intended? \\n*   More than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn’t?\\n*   Spent a lot of time drinking? Or being sick or getting over the after-effects? \\n*   Experienced craving – a strong need, or urge, to drink\\n*   Found that drinking – or being sick from drinking – often interfered with taking care of your home or family? Or caused job troubles? Or school problems? \\n*   Continued to drink even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? \\n*   Given up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you, or gave you pleasure, in order to drink?\\n*   More than once gotten into situations while or after drinking that increased your chances of getting hurt (such as driving, swimming, using machinery, walking in a dangerous area, or having unsafe sex)? \\n*   Continued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem? Or after having had a memory blackout? \\n*   Had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before? \\n*   Found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms, such as trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, nausea, or sweating? Or sensed things that were not there?\\n\\nIf you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more urgent the need for change. A health professional can conduct a formal assessment of your symptoms to see if an alcohol use disorder is present. However severe the problem may seem, most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from treatment. Unfortunately, only a fraction of people who could benefit from treatment receive help. In 2012, for example, 1.4 million adults received treatment for an AUD at a specialized facility (8.4 percent of adults in need). This included 416,000 women (7.3 percent of women in need) and 1.0 million men (8.9 percent of men in need).", "title": " Alcohol Use Disorder", "summary": "Problem drinking that becomes severe is given the medical diagnosis of “alcohol use disorder” or AUD.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-17 17:30:40.502667+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:51:20.846714+00	\N	f

Children who grow up with repeated experiences such as being neglected by parents with alcoholism or mental illness, being verbally degraded, being physically struck, or sexually abused will very likely form negative beliefs about themselves that can last through adulthood. These children may begin to believe that they are bad or evil, that there is something wrong with them, or that they deserved what was being done to them. To be crystal clear: no child ever deserves to be treated in such a way. Some children begin to believe that they are permanently damaged by these experiences and that they cannot have healthy relationships. Believing that you are bad, defective, or permanently damaged can contribute to developing depression and suicidal thoughts. When people anticipate that they cannot be a regular, healthy person, have healthy relationships, or feel at home among “normal” people, they may develop a sense of hopelessness. When someone feels hopeless for an extended period of time, depression can develop, and may last for weeks, months, or longer. In a depressive episode, nearly everything seems negative—the future seems bleak, it seems as though no one likes you, and everything you do seems to be wrong. Some people begin to think about suicide as if it would be a way out of their problems. For those with a history of multiple adverse childhood events, the likelihood of depression or suicide attempts is significantly increased. In one study, fully 50% of those with a history of 4 or more adverse childhood events had been depressed in the previous year, well above the population average of about 15%. Notice, however, that fully 50% of those with the same history were not depressed in the previous year. It is very clear from the research that even people who experienced severe childhood abuse can go on to have healthy, stable, and deeply satisfying close relationships with friends, spouses, and children. Being at risk for depression or suicidal thoughts does not mean that these events have to happen—history is not destiny. And if depression does occur, there are many effective treatments that have helped many fully recover from depression. These include cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, as well as some medications. These interventions can help to reduce or resolve depressive symptoms and make depression much less likely to occur again. These same interventions can also be highly effective in reducing or resolving thoughts of suicide. \\n\\nThe Cordico Wellness app includes a module on Depression, which describes symptoms and treatment in more detail. If you have been experiencing depression, it is strongly recommended that you review the Depression module, or use the Therapist Finder or other resource to schedule an appointment with a provider who can offer evidence-based treatment for depression. Evidence-based treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy, and some antidepressant medications. Taking steps to address depression with a provider can help you recover from depression more quickly. If you had significant experience with adverse childhood events such as abuse, neglect, or a chaotic family environment, a therapist can also help you to recognize consequences that these experiences may have had, and help you develop strategies to become more effective and more satisfied in your life.", "title": "Effects on Psychological Functioning ", "summary": "Experiencing four or more types of adverse childhood events is associated with a significantly increased risk of depression, as well as suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-20 15:58:23.904677+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 21:23:52.022507+00	\N	f

For example, nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco, temporarily helps some people to regulate their mood, and can temporarily reduce distress. Alcohol reduces the unpleasant experience of fear and anxiety, and temporarily reduces disturbing images of abuse. Eating higher-sugar foods can also serve to distract away from emotional distress. As a result, those who were more frequently distressed by chaos, abuse, or other stressors at home, would have been more likely to begin using alcohol, cigarettes, illicit drugs, and overeating while young, and then to reach for these as a way of managing their difficult emotions. Over time, these behaviors become strong habits that are difficult to change, which may then lead to health problems including obesity, liver disease, lung conditions, heart conditions, and many forms of cancer. \\n\\nAdverse childhood may contribute to later depression and suicide attempts in multiple ways. Being repeatedly abused or chronically neglected may lead a person to believe that he or she is worthless, defective, damaged, or unlovable. Growing up in an environment that is disorganized, unpredictable, or with parents who are highly inconsistent or irresponsible, may deprive a child of role models or guidance for how to cope effectively, how to care for oneself, how to interact with others appropriately, how to develop and maintain healthy relationships, and so on. As a result, those from such backgrounds may enter adulthood without a template for what to do to care for themselves and their relationships in healthy and effective ways. As a result, friendships and relationships may have recurring problems.

Signals to the heart immediately cause it to work faster and more forcefully, pumping greater volumes of blood to the muscles, as they require more oxygen and glucose (blood sugar) when they are more active. Other signals cause our breathing rate to increase, so that more oxygen can be drawn into the blood to support the increased oxygen need of the hard-working large muscle groups. Signals to the adrenal glands cause them to dump adrenaline into the bloodstream to activate the release of energy stores, and to increase physical arousal. The pupils of the eyes dilate, getting wider to allow more visual input to detect potential threats. Rapid changes in the network of blood vessels causes more blood to be sent to the large muscles, by relaxing and widening these arteries, to allow for rapid, powerful movements, such as running or fighting. At the same time, blood flow to the digestive system is reduced, by constricting and narrowing these arteries, because digesting and storing energy is less important in an emergency than having blood flow provide all the fuel and oxygen that the large muscles in the legs, arms, and trunk need to respond to the threat. At the very same time these changes in the body occur, a part of the brain called the amygdala is rapidly activated. This part of the brain is related to strong emotions, including anger and fear. When activated, we become highly energized, alert, and ready to take physical action. \\n\\nThe fight-or-flight response is caused by activation of the _Sympathetic_ branch of the Autonomic Nervous System. The autonomic nervous system controls automatic, involuntary functions, like digestion, heart rate, sweating, and others. The _Sympathetic_ branch of the autonomic nervous system is balanced by the Parasympathetic branch. While the _Sympathetic_ branch supports the fight-or-flight response, the function of the Parasympathetic branch is rest-and-digest. When there is no emergency or threat to deal with, the Parasympathetic branch is most active, slowing down heart rate, relaxing the muscles, slowing metabolic activity, and increasing digestive activity. Its primary function is to store up food and conserve energy, so that it will be readily available when needed. Whenever the _Sympathetic_ branch has been activated for a period of time to deal with a threat or emergency, the Parasympathetic branch will eventually become activated, turning down all of the emergency response activity, and returning the body to a more quiet, relaxed, and resting status.", "title": "Fight-or-Flight Effects in the Body", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 13:48:40.971289+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 13:48:40.971289+00	\N	f

Because it is nearly inevitable that you will lose someone you care about, it may be helpful to understand the nature of grief following a loss.", "title": "Emotional Responses to Loss ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:40:55.236867+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:53:00.416536+00	\N	f

It would be unrealistic to expect any two people be closely matched on all of these important dimensions, but couples sometimes experience conflict when the differences are viewed as defects in the other partner. For example, Sharon likes to go out several times a month with friends for live music or drinks, while Mark prefers to have quiet nights at home, reading or watching movies. Neither preference is wrong, but conflict can emerge if Sharon accuses Mark of being boring; or Mark asks Sharon why she can't enjoy a quiet night at home.", "title": "Differences in Preferences", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 21:57:45.228559+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:58:12.287308+00	\N	f

With solid communication skills under your belt, you and your partner can work through some of the other issues that may have created difficulties in your relationship. One of the best techniques for effective communication is called the “Speaker-Listener” technique. Described by relationship researchers Howard Markman and Scott Stanley in their Fighting for Your Marriage book and video program, this technique involves designating a time for discussing a topic, and having one person start as the “Speaker,” signified by holding an object in the hand. (The authors actually have their clients use a tile, to signify who “has the floor”.) The couple picks only one topic at a time to discuss until that has been resolved. The Speaker expresses his or her point of view, generally using “I” statements, such as “I would like for X to happen.” After each sentence or two, the Listener paraphrases or summarizes what the Speaker has said, without disputing the statement and without expressing any strong emotion. \\n\\n**Key Point:** The purpose of the Speaker-Listener technique is to ensure that the Speaker feels accurately understood, and that the Listener has paid careful attention to the Speaker’s statements, instead of formulating a rebuttal or otherwise disagreeing. After the Speaker has had the opportunity to express one or two points, the roles reverse; the Listener takes the object and becomes the Speaker, and then expresses his or her thoughts. The Speaker-Listener exercise is finished once both parties feel understood after expressing their point of view, and clearly understand their partner’s point of view. \\n\\n**Key Point:** Although this technique may feel somewhat formal and artificial, it is in fact the structure of the technique that helps to prevent a difference of opinion from turning into an angry argument. In addition, having a clear and complete understanding of your partner’s perspective – their concerns, their interpretations, and their wishes – can significantly deepen the sense of intimacy and connection. This is further strengthened by feeling that your partner deeply understands you.", "title": "Communication Strategies Part I", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 22:08:33.584198+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:58:30.723835+00	\N	f

For example, the death from an extended illness of an elderly retired colleague who you knew only casually would likely trigger only a mild sense of grief, or perhaps only sympathy for his family. In contrast, the sudden death of a partner or close colleague in the line of duty would cause much more intense feelings of grief, both because of the closeness of the relationship, and because the sudden nature of the death gives no time to anticipate and prepare for the event.\\n\\nThe most devastating type of loss for many is the death of their own child or a young close relative. Compared with the death of an elderly person, the death of a young child triggers more intense emotions because their future has been cut short, depriving them of the important life experiences most of us expect. In addition, the desire to protect the vulnerable is especially strong when it comes to children.\\n\\nIn any case, there is no single \\"correct\\" way to feel after learning that someone has died. Stronger than expected feelings may emerge if the deceased reminds you of someone important to you. Conversely, the passing of a cherished and highly respected colleague or family member may evoke much less intense emotions than expected if the person was elderly, or if your esteem and respect for the colleague did not translate to feeling close or connected with them. A useful response is to simply notice the emotions that you experience without trying either to change or avoid them.", "title": "Factors Affecting the Experiences of Grief ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:37:23.94534+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:53:24.881767+00	\N	f

The introduction of _Acceptance_ as an alternative or complement to traditional _Change_\\\\-based strategies, has had great success in enhancing relationship intimacy and improving relationship quality.

However, sometimes our automatic information processing is inaccurate and leads us to assume that someone was being insulting when they intended to be playful, or to interpret someone's comments as critical when they were meant to be useful feedback. If you have been angry in the past with someone, it can be worth considering other explanations for the behavior or statements that resulted in you feeling angry. You might try writing down the thoughts you were having when you were angry (for example, \\"He was trying to embarrass me in front of my colleagues,\\" or \\"She was taking all the credit for my ideas\\"). After writing down this thought, consider the evidence that supports this interpretation. Next, write down evidence that would support a different interpretation of what happened. After reviewing the different possibilities, ask yourself what would probably be the most accurate and objective interpretation of the events. This process often results in more benign interpretations that are less likely to promote anger. You can then rehearse this type of mental process when you encounter similar situations.\\n\\n**Develop Useful Self-Instructions**\\n\\nOur stream of thought can influence us for good or ill. If your stream of thought includes statements like, \\"I'm being taken advantage of,\\" \\"I'm being treated unfairly,\\" or \\"Nothing ever goes right for me,\\" you will likely feel angry and resentful. While there may be a grain of truth to some of these thoughts, it can be useful to choose a more helpful and effective form of self-talk. For example, \\"Even if things aren't going perfectly for me, I can do my best with what I have\\" or \\"I can be generous and kind to others, even if I am not treated perfectly fair.\\"\\n\\nTo practice replacing anger-inducing thoughts with more helpful thoughts, it can be useful to develop phrases like these that you can write out on coping cards, and to refer to these periodically for a few weeks, so that they become very familiar. They can also travel with you in your pocket or bag, so that if you are about to enter a situation or encounter a person that you have had anger problems with in the past, you can review the coping cards in advance, mentally rehearsing how you will handle anticipated triggers.\\n\\nTo help decide what kinds of coping card statements to develop, try making a Cost-Benefit Analysis in which you weigh the advantages and disadvantages of allowing yourself to become angry, against the advantages and disadvantages of managing your emotions more effectively. An advantage of becoming angry at a co-worker might be that you will experience some satisfaction in saying what's on your mind; a disadvantage could be harmful to your work relationships and work reputation. Weighing these advantages and disadvantages in a clear, objective way can help you to decide which option is best for you in the long run, and allow you to take deliberate steps toward more effective emotion regulation.\\n\\n**Lowering Arousal**\\n\\nAnger is associated with significant physiological arousal, including increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, quicker breathing, and muscle tension. You may notice your fists clenching or your jaw tightening, and may feel flushing in the neck and face. These automatic changes are part of the fight-or-flight response, preparing us to confront physical danger. However, they are not particularly useful in the work environment. There are several easy methods for reducing this physiological arousal.\\n\\nGuided breathing exercises for maintaining calm can be learned quickly through available online scripts. These exercises counter the rapid, shallow breathing that occurs when angry, and induce significant relaxation and calm. By practicing this regularly on your own, you will be able to quickly and easily turn to this strategy to induce a state of calm in situations when you notice anger starting to rise. During practice, sit comfortably, place one hand over the belly, and take a deep breath, noting the rise and fall of the belly as the breath goes in, and then slowly, calmly goes out. Many people find it useful to visualize themselves breathing in calmness, and breathing out the tension as they exhale.\\n\\n**Guided Relaxation**\\n\\nSimilarly, practicing progressive muscle relaxation or relaxation through body scan or directed relaxation helps you develop the ability to quickly induce a relaxed calm state. As you become very familiar with the physical sensations and mental state of deep relaxation, you will find it much easier to instruct yourself to relax and become calm in situations in which you might find yourself becoming angry.\\n\\n**Meditation**\\n\\nSeveral different forms of meditation exist, and as yet there is no clear advantage of one method over the others. However, the regular practice of meditation has been shown to reduce arousal and tension, and enhance positive emotions, as well as reduce negative emotions such as anger. There are many freely available guided meditation audio scripts available online, so you can select the type that would work best for you. It is also useful to learn and practice mini-relaxation exercises so that these highly efficient stress management techniques can be utilized when time is limited. \\n\\n**Key Point:** There are many different coping strategies for managing anger.

As described by Marshall Goldsmith in his book \\"Triggers,\\" the idea is to list simple valued goals that you want to work toward, and at the end of the day rate yourself on a 1-10 scale in terms of how well you tried to achieve those goals. With a goal of being less angry, appropriate daily questions could include:\\n\\n*   Did I do my best to be patient? (1-10)\\n*   Did I do my best to be forgiving? (1-10)\\n*   Did I do my best to develop harmonious relationships? (1-10)\\n\\nThese questions can be modified to better match your specific goals. Spending perhaps 30 seconds at the end of each day to consider whether you did your best at each of these endeavors can, over time, help to shape your behavior during the next day. In reviewing your performance for the day, you notice what choices you made, what strategies you used, and what you did well. In addition, you will notice mistakes or slip-ups that may have occurred, and can use these to plan in advance how you would handle similar situations, either through coping cards, self-talk, or better anticipation of triggers in the future.\\n\\n**Key Point:** Succeeding in changing behavior requires a long-term commitment and sustained, focused effort.

Signals to the heart immediately cause it to work faster and more forcefully, pumping greater volumes of blood to the muscles, as they require more oxygen and glucose (blood sugar) when they are more active. Other signals cause our breathing rate to increase, so that more oxygen can be drawn into the blood to support the increased oxygen need of the hard-working large muscle groups. Signals to the adrenal glands cause them to dump adrenaline into the bloodstream to activate the release of energy stores, and to increase physical arousal. The pupils of the eyes dilate, getting wider to allow more visual input to detect potential threats. Rapid changes in the network of blood vessels cause more blood to be sent to the large muscles, by relaxing and widening these arteries, to allow for rapid, powerful movements, such as running or fighting. At the same time, blood flow to the digestive system is reduced, by constricting and narrowing these arteries, because digesting and storing energy is less important in an emergency than having blood flow provide all the fuel and oxygen that the large muscles in the legs, arms, and trunk need to respond to the threat. At the very same time these changes in the body occur, a part of the brain called the amygdala is rapidly activated. This part of the brain is related to strong emotions, including anger and fear. When activated, we become highly energized, alert, and ready to take physical action. \\n\\nThe fight-or-flight response is caused by activation of the _Sympathetic_ branch of the Autonomic Nervous System. The autonomic nervous system controls automatic, involuntary functions, like digestion, heart rate, sweating, and others. The _Sympathetic_ branch of the autonomic nervous system is balanced by the Parasympathetic branch. While the _Sympathetic_ branch supports the fight-or-flight response, the function of the Parasympathetic branch is rest-and-digest. When there is no emergency or threat to deal with, the Parasympathetic branch is most active, slowing down heart rate, relaxing the muscles, slowing metabolic activity, and increasing digestive activity. Its primary function is to store up food and conserve energy so that it will be readily available when needed. Whenever the _Sympathetic_ branch has been activated for a period of time to deal with a threat or emergency, the Parasympathetic branch will eventually become activated, turning down all of the emergency response activity, and returning the body to a more quiet, relaxed, and resting status.", "title": "Fight-or-Flight Effects in the Body ", "summary": "The fight-or-flight system produces several immediate changes in the brain and body that maximize our ability to fight off an attack, or run from a dangerous threat.

Habits are generally labeled as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" because they generate a repeated impact on our lives that we consider to be either positive or negative. Good (or healthy) habits have a positive impact, whereas bad habits have a negative (or unhealthy) impact. The problem with unhealthy habits is that they often tend to persist despite our desire for change. Fortunately, by better understanding the mechanisms driving our habits, we're better positioned to reengineer our routines to suit our values and preferences.\\n\\nUnhealthy habits tend to share three things in common: 1) we suffer one or more negative consequences from the habit, 2) we endure these negative consequences in return for a temporary (often paltry) sense of reward or relief, and 3) over time, these habits tend to erode our quality of life. Some examples of bad habits include smoking, overeating, excessive alcohol consumption, watching too much TV, and spending too much time online.\\n\\nGood habits, on the other hand, tend to help us be more healthy, productive, or fulfilled in our lives. In this way, we benefit from our own momentum, carried along by our automatic tendencies and preferences as we engage in actions that enhance our quality of life.

For example, because the digestion process is inhibited during the fight-or-flight response, the production of saliva (spit) decreases dramatically. Have you ever noticed that your mouth becomes very dry in high-stress situations? The fight-or-flight circuit has turned down saliva production in order to activate more important processes. This cottonmouth feeling can seem strange, and for some people it contributes to a sense that something is very wrong; this can make them feel even more threatened or stressed and can become a distraction. Blood supply to the extremities (hands, feet, and face) is reduced, possibly to reduce blood loss if injured. This can result in one's face appearing pale and having the hands and feet feel cold. The increased speed and force of the heart helps circulate blood to make energy more available to the muscles, but it can also feel like a jackhammer is pounding at your chest wall. Some people interpret this pounding as a signal that they are having a heart attack, and this can also become a distraction during high-stress situations. The same goes for the increased breathing rate; some people start to feel short of breath, as though they can't quite catch their breath.

We use the term panic attack when the fight-or-flight response is activated in non-dangerous situations; in other words, a panic attack is a false alarm in the fight-or-flight system. Think of a car alarm: if someone tries to break into a car when the alarm is set, the sensors in the alarm will detect the motion caused by the thief's attempts, triggering the alarm mechanism. The alarm will sound, lights will flash, and the thief will be warned off. But the same car alarm may be triggered simply by other vehicles driving by, causing the car to rock slightly. Even though there is no attempted break-in, this movement sets off a false alarm. The sounds and flashing lights are just as intense for the false alarm as when someone is actually trying to break in; once the alarm circuitry is tripped, it responds with full strength.\\n\\nThe process is similar to the fight-or-flight response and panic attacks. Many people, especially during periods of stress, will have the input to their threat detection system reach a critical threshold so that the fight-or-flight switch gets thrown. At this point, it is very much like a car alarm going off all of the intensity of a full-blown response to a threat are set off, so that one's heart pounds rapidly, the mouth goes dry, breathing gets rapid, and a feeling of impending doom and a need to escape may seem overwhelming. Panic attacks are not dangerous by themselves; they don't cause any physical harm and don't mean that anything is medically or psychologically wrong. However, sometimes people become distracted by the sensations of a panic attack because they misinterpret them as a sign that they are having a heart attack, or losing their mind. It is helpful to remember that having your heart race or pound in your chest will not harm you, nor will feeling short of breath or sweating. Quite the opposite these sensations are an indication that your body is fully charged and ready to take on challenges. Remember that a racing heart, sweating, and shortness of breath are what elite professional football and basketball players experience much of the time when they are at work, and they perform incredible physical feats while feeling that way.\\n\\nAt the same time, athletes can perform superbly with a racing heart and shortness of breath because they are used to feeling that way they are so familiar with the sensations that they are not distracted by them. As a dispatcher, it is important that you be aware of the physical sensations of anxiety, including panic attacks, so that you do not become distracted by these sensations during high-stress situations. This article includes descriptions of what happens biologically during anxiety and panic, the reasons for anxiety and panic responses, and common sensations, emotions, and thoughts that often go along with anxiety and panic. While reviewing this material, it would be helpful if you would try to focus on the described sensations and even see if you can reproduce some of the sensations. You could also recall a time when you felt highly anxious or panicked, and just observe those sensations, thoughts, and emotions in your mind. The more that you can become a neutral observer of these sensations, and the more familiar you can become with them as a neutral observer, the less distracted you will be by these sensations in high-stress situations. For example, you may feel your heart pounding in your chest and just remind yourself, Yep, there's the fight-or-flight response, hard at work. By understanding and being familiar with the sensations of the fight-or-flight response, your ability to focus on the situation at hand, and to quickly make appropriate decisions, will likely be enhanced.", "title": "Panic Attacks as \\"False Alarms\\"", "summary": "If the fight-or-flight response was activated in an objectively dangerous situation, we would simply call this normal fear.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-20 18:58:05.960125+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 21:32:07.342549+00	\N	f

You can try to simply observe the sensations and emotions, and allow them to fade. You can also bring the panic attack to an end more quickly by engaging in slow, deep diaphragmatic breathing (or belly breathing). You can practice this form of breathing when you are not having a panic attack so that in the future you will be more familiar with this skill and so can use it more easily. While seated, place your hand on your belly, and breath in so that your stomach expands outward as you breathe in. Breathe slowly, counting 4 seconds as you inhale, then 6 seconds as you exhale, pausing briefly before inhaling again. Your hand on your belly will help you to continue with more relaxed, belly breathing, instead of the shallower breathing from the chest that tends to occur when tense or anxious. By practicing this belly breathing, you can develop greater control over the rate of your breathing, so that if you notice anxious, panic-like sensations, such as shortness of breath, you can remember to engage in this breathing exercise, if the situation allows. Another benefit of practicing belly breathing periodically is that it allows you to store memories of the physical feelings of deep relaxation and calm breathing. When you are in a stressful situation and beginning to feel tense, you can activate the memory of feeling calm and deeply relaxed, and this can help you to become calmer, so that you think more clearly and respond more effectively.", "title": "Breathing Exercises", "summary": "If a panic attack does occur, it can be useful to remember that it is a false alarm and that the physical sensations and strong emotions are not causing any physical harm.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-20 19:00:27.465473+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 21:32:22.408445+00	\N	f

The primary function of worry is to anticipate future problems and then take steps to address these problems. If instead someone simply broods about the anticipated problem, thinking about it over and over, and feeling helpless, they are letting their helpful worry system turn into a liability. Some people continue to worry because it temporarily reduces their concerns. For example, some people have the sense that, _I won't forget this important task as long as I keep thinking of it every few minutes, or, If I keep thinking about work tomorrow I won't make important mistakes; if I stop thinking about it I may forget something important_. As a result, it can be hard for them to let go of their worrying behavior. At the same time, letting the same worries cycle through the mind every few minutes without taking action to solve the problem uses up mental capacity, taking away attention from other important tasks.

5523a778-cf7f-4705-885d-8359035ee806	LE - Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Worry - Cognitive Strategies to Manage Worry	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Cognitive Strategies to Manage Worry**\\n\\n\\nThere are several different cognitive strategies to help limit the negative impact of worrying. For each strategy, first, identify and write down specifically what worries are showing up in your mind. Try to be complete in listing your worries, and if more worry thoughts show up after your first pass, add them to the list of worries. You can then run each worry through the simple but effective cognitive techniques explained below. \\n\\n**Examine the Evidence**\\n\\nFor each worry, write down in one column any evidence that the worrying outcome is likely to happen. For example, if your worry thought is, \\"I'm going to lose my job,\\" write down all of the reasonable evidence you come up with that this is true that you really are going to lose your job (for example, \\"I made a mistake at work last week\\"). Next, in a separate column, write down all the evidence that this worry is not true (for example, \\"My supervisor gave positive feedback on my performance yesterday\\"). After putting down all of the evidence you can think of, assign an estimated weight to the evidence for and the evidence against this worry, and see which viewpoint outweighs the other. For example, if you list only two items as evidence that you are going to lose your job, but list ten items that you are not going to lose your job, the weight of evidence would be much stronger against your worry. Examining the evidence for each worry can give you a more accurate and realistic perspective, and in some cases, the persistent worry will naturally fade away as a result. If examining the evidence is not sufficient, try the Downward Arrow Technique.\\n\\n**Downward Arrow**\\n\\nFor each worry that you listed that is still causing you concern, ask yourself, \\"If this were true, what would be so bad about it? What would it mean?\\" Write down your answer to that question, and then pose the same question to that answer, and to the next answer, until you eventually reach the most basic concern.\\n\\nFor example, if the worrying thought is, \\"I'm going to make a mistake that causes me to lose my job,\\" you would ask yourself, \\"If this were true, what would be so bad, and what would it mean?\\" Your response might be, \\"If I make a mistake on duty, everyone at work will know about it.\\" The downward arrow technique would look something like this:\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/arrow_technique2.png)  \\n\\nOnce you have explicitly written out the levels of concerns that are behind your recurring worries, you can then consider how realistic these concerns are. If you are unsure, you can examine the evidence for and against each level of the worrying thought. However, for many, simply writing out on paper the underlying concern allows them to see that their concerns are unlikely to occur. This can help reduce the frequency and intensity of the worry. But a third technique is available as well.\\n\\n**List Solutions and Ways of Coping**\\n\\nSometimes our worries are unfounded, but sometimes they are at least partly true. For example, the worry, \\"I won't be able to pay my bills this month\\" would be realistic for someone who has been spending too much. Obviously, simply worrying about this won't help. Instead, writing down a realistic plan to reduce spending and to save enough money to pay bills can both take care of your financial problem, and also allow you to stop worrying. If your realistic, written plan for your finances shows that you will still come up short at the end of the month, you can then write down several possible solutions to this problem, such as a) take on extra work, b) ask for a temporary loan, c) sell some used items that are no longer needed.\\n\\nWorrying persists when we don't have a clear solution to the problem. By taking just a few minutes to clearly write out the nature of the worry, and listing some concrete solutions to the problem, you can free up your mental space for more productive activities.\\n\\n**Make Checklists of Helpful Actions**\\n\\nIf the things you are worried about can be addressed through taking some action, make a checklist of the actions and then check off each item when you have completed it. For example, if you are worried about your health, actions you could take would include getting a medical checkup, buying a blood pressure instrument that you can use at home, and starting an exercise routine. You can write these tasks out on a checklist, and then check each off once you have made a doctor's appointment, ordered a blood pressure cuff, and decided on an exercise routine, and scheduled start date. Taking these actions allows you to get these recurrent worrying thoughts out of your head, freeing up mental capacity to allow you to think more clearly and work more effectively.", "title": "Cognitive Strategies to Manage Worry", "summary": "There are several different cognitive strategies to help limit the negative impact of worrying.

For nonsmokers, regular exercise has the most impact on health. However, many people find it difficult to start or persist in regular exercise. Some blame a busy lifestyle, where exercise is the first thing to be pushed off the schedule. Others feel too tired to get up and run 5 miles, and so instead go online, watch TV, or do any number of sedentary activities. Those who are out of shape, overweight, or both, often avoid starting exercise because they dread the huffing and puffing, the rapid fatigue, and perhaps the anticipation that others may look down on them for appearing overweight or out of shape. These are all examples of avoidance behaviors letting the short-term discomfort of starting to exercise stand in the way of enjoying the long-term benefits of regular exercise. \\n\\nFortunately, one of the marvels of the human machine is how quickly it responds to exercise. After starting out with even a brief, moderately paced walking routine, most people quickly find that they are able to go further the next day, at a quicker pace, and that they feel more energized after doing so. Because the first 2-4 days of starting an exercise habit tends to be the most difficult, a great strategy is to try to commit seriously to exercising on those first 4 days no matter what rain or shine, whether tired, unmotivated, stressed, or discouraged. Committing oneself to simply putting on exercise shoes, making it to the door, and then stepping outside, can create a behavioral momentum that overcomes the inertia of remaining sedentary. For most people, after the first few days of beginning the exercise routine, they have much less difficulty getting started and begin to look forward to it, feeling energized and more positive during and after the exercise.\\n\\nIn addition to improvements in cardiovascular fitness, weight management, and muscle tone, regular exercise has been identified as one of the most important factors in maintaining memory functioning and preventing dementia. Regular exercise has also been shown to increase serotonin levels, which improves mood so effectively that regular exercise is a scientifically supported treatment for depression, as effective as antidepressant medication or psychotherapy.\\n\\nIt bears repeating: for nonsmokers, starting or continuing with regular cardiovascular exercise is the single most powerful activity for improving overall physical and emotional well-being.\\n\\n[Click Here](https://www.worldfitnesslevel.org/#/) if you're interested in taking a free online assessment that will provide you with a quick estimate of your physical fitness level.

People who frequently sleep less than 7 hours per night are at increased risk for infectious diseases, including colds and influenza. While it may make you feel productive to stay up late or get up early to complete more work, being sick for days or weeks with cold or flu can more than offset the extra hour or two of late-night work. In the long run, work productivity is stronger and steadier in those who engage in focused work through the day, but then switch off and ensure they get to bed in time for 7-8 hours of sleep. Research has also shown repeatedly that much of our memory consolidation occurs during sleep, and that memory performance is significantly worse when sleep is interrupted or too brief. So, staying up late reading for work may result in poorer memory for what was read, making those extra hours less efficient. Similarly, concentration and learning abilities are significantly worse when we don't get enough sleep, making each hour of the workday less efficient and less productive. And finally, it is well known that sleep-deprived people are more irritable, and may be prone to dysphoric or even depressed moods, all of which affect the quality of life, interpersonal relationships, and work productivity.\\n\\nTo achieve the important goal of getting 7-8 hours of sleep most nights, one helpful approach is to establish a [sleep routine](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/healthy-sleep-tips).

You may have heard that learning a new language, or working crossword puzzles, or visiting museums, or learning a new skill, will strengthen your brain and improve your cognitive abilities. Other supposed brain-enhancing activities include taking continuing education college courses, learning a new language, eating dark chocolate, or using supplements such as ginkgo biloba. [Lumosity](https://www.lumosity.com/en/), [Cogmed](https://www.cogmed.com/), and other commercial brain fitness programs have made claims that practicing cognitive tasks with their computer programs will enhance some cognitive abilities and brain functioning. \\n\\nHowever, for most of these, there is little evidence that they have any effect on the brain or memory. In fact, the company behind Lumosity agreed to a $2 million settlement in 2016 with the Federal Trade Commission for making claims about the effectiveness of their program that were not supported by evidence. Similarly, many supplements that are sold supposedly to improve brain health have little or no research to indicate that the supplements either make the brain healthier or improve memory or other cognitive abilities. A recent article from a Harvard Medical School newsletter stated the case bluntly in the title: [_Don't buy into brain health supplements._](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/dont-buy-into-brain-health-supplements) They noted that, although around 25% of people 50 years or older use some form of brain-enhancing supplement, a review of the evidence does not show that they are effective at all. \\n\\nSo now that we know there are reasons to be skeptical of claims related to brain health, is there anything that does help keep our brain healthy, and enhance our cognitive ability? Fortunately, the answer is yes. First, we will take a look at studies in which brain health and cognitive functioning, usually memory, are related to certain kinds of activities. Then we will look at more carefully controlled research that demonstrates that some activities clearly provide significant benefits for brain health. \\n\\n**Correlational Studies**\\n\\nA number of studies find that people who are more cognitively fit (with better memory and concentration abilities) do several things differently than people whose cognitive abilities have started to decline. Cognitively fit people socialize more often, take more trips, read more books, spend more time working crossword puzzles and other mentally challenging tasks, exercise more frequently, and are less likely to be obese. \\n\\nThese findings suggest that if we simply do the same things that cognitively fit people do, we ourselves can become and remain cognitively fit, and keep our brains healthy. However, this kind of research is correlational and does not allow us to conclude that engaging in different activities caused greater cognitive fitness. In these studies, researchers ask groups of people how frequently they work crossword puzzles, or take classes on topics of interest, or visit museums; and then measure their cognitive fitness or do a brain scan. If they find that people who solve crossword puzzles frequently also have better memories or greater brain volume, it is tempting to draw the conclusion that crossword puzzles caused improved brain health. This is a mistake because it is just as plausible that people with healthier brains and greater cognitive fitness maintain higher levels of curiosity and energy that lead them to choose to solve crossword puzzles, socialize, travel, visit museums, or exercise. From a correlational study, we can't conclude whether crossword puzzles improve brain health, or having better brain health makes someone more likely to enjoy solving crossword puzzles, or if another factor affects both of these. For example, the socioeconomic status into which one was born may be related to better nutrition, development of better health habits, as well as more frequent exposure to reading and other cognitive activities, all of which may result in a correlation in which people with healthy brains also complete crosswords and visit museums. As a result, we cannot know whether deciding to start crossword puzzles will have any effect on brain health or cognitive fitness. \\n\\nA different research approach involves taking a group of people and randomly assigning them to either be in a Control Group, or in some sort of Treatment Group. For example, a group of sedentary but otherwise healthy adults could be randomly assigned so that half remained sedentary, while half would begin a supervised exercise routine. If we test their memory and other cognitive abilities at the end of the experiment, if we observe any improvement in the Exercise Treatment Group compared with the Control Group we can say that the exercise caused the cognitive improvement.", "title": "Many Claims and Little Evidence", "summary": "There are many programs and practices that claim to improve brain health and cognitive fitness.

Most of these involve people who are middle-aged or older, so that they are at greater risk for cognitive decline. A few studies actually studied people with early signs of dementia, referred to as mild cognitive impairment. The studies compared treatment groups and control groups on cognitive outcome measures, such as performance on memory tasks or problem-solving tasks; or they did brain imaging studies using CT (computerized tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which create virtual images of slices of the brain, so that we can see if certain brain areas are larger or smaller in one of the groups compared to the other. Some of the studies use a procedure called functional MRI (fMRI), which creates images of brain activation, showing which parts of the brain are highly engaged at a given time. With fMRI, multiple images of brain activation are created each second, resulting in a sort of video of brain activity across a period of time. This allows researchers to examine how active different brain areas become when processing information, and also allows them to detect patterns of connection among the different brain areas. In general, more connections among different brain areas are better, because this higher degree of brain connectivity allows for a greater amount of information to be processed more rapidly. \\n\\n**Strong Evidence for the Effectiveness of Exercise on Cognitive Functioning**\\n\\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that people across a variety of age ranges tend to perform better on cognitive tasks if they also have a high level of physical fitness and engage in regular aerobic exercise. In addition, experiments have been conducted in which people are randomly assigned either to exercise or not exercise, and their cognitive performance is measured at the start and end of the study (i.e., before they begin the exercise program, and again after they have finished several weeks of the exercise program). In one randomized assigned study of healthy younger adults (Stern et al 2019), those who were assigned to an aerobic exercise condition performed significantly better after 6 months of exercise on several cognitive measures (compared with their cognitive performance before the study). The researchers described the amount of improvement on cognitive tasks when compared with the no-exercise control group, as being approximately equal to a 40-year-old performing as well as a 30-year-old. For older participants the improvement was even more striking; for a 60-year-old participant, the improvement was similar to being 20 years younger. In other words, engaging in regular aerobic exercise appeared to take years, or even decades off of their normal age-related cognitive decline, making their performance on some cognitive tasks as strong as if they had become many years younger. \\n\\nOne meta-analysis paper combined the results of 29 different randomized studies. The researchers concluded that the overall finding from these 29 studies revealed, significant cognitive benefits from sustained exercises in adults. The cognitive benefits include improvements in tasks that involve memory, attention, problem-solving, and planning, as well as processing speed (the ability to quickly take in information and respond appropriately). \\n\\nTo summarize, there is a very large body of carefully controlled research indicating that regular aerobic exercise significantly improves cognitive fitness. In addition, this regular exercise offers a powerful buffer against the natural cognitive decline that starts by age 30 and progresses with increasing age. \\n\\n**Effects of Exercise on Brain Structure and Function**\\n\\nIn a follow-up study, these researchers randomly assigned participants to either an aerobic exercise group or to a non-exercise control group that engaged in a stretching activity. At the end of the study several weeks later, functional MRI (fMRI) showed that those in the aerobic exercise group had significantly greater levels of brain activity in areas of the brain related to attentional control. These findings suggest that involvement in regular aerobic exercise resulted in improvements in the way the brain behaved during cognitive tasks. In other words, starting a program of regular aerobic exercise improved the connections among different brain areas. This is consistent with the studies described earlier that indicate improvement in performing cognitive tasks after starting to exercise. \\n\\nIn one review of studies, the size of the hippocampus (a brain structure that is critical for forming new memories) was significantly larger in those who engaged in 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, along with significantly better memory performance. Several other studies have specifically found larger hippocampus size in people who engage in regular exercise. This is especially important because the hippocampus naturally shrinks with normal aging; in addition, the hippocampus is especially damaged by Alzheimer's dementia, leading to profound problems in forming new memories. Given these findings, it seems clear that regular exercise is a strong protective factor in maintaining good memory performance, and preventing or slowing the loss of brain tissue that occurs with natural aging.", "title": "Cardiovascular Exercise, Brain Health, and Cognitive Fitness", "summary": "There are several well-designed studies that use experimental design, and we will review some of the more important of these below.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-20 20:26:36.835227+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:01:29.906752+00	\N	f

This would include activities that increase heart rate and require increased respiration (in other words, exercises that make you at least somewhat out of breath). Examples would include running, bicycling, swimming, walking or hiking at a brisk pace (enough to get somewhat out of breath), and playing basketball or tennis. This could also include chores like mowing the lawn with a push mower, raking leaves at a good pace, chopping wood, and so on. \\n\\nIt is less clear whether other forms of exercise, such as weight lifting, resistance training, or yoga, are effective for brain health and cognitive fitness. However, at least a few studies have shown improved cognitive functioning after starting a weight lifting program. Certainly, there does not appear to be any negative effects on cognition of starting or adding a weight training or yoga program; however, if you want to follow the best evidence for brain health and cognitive fitness, an aerobic exercise program is far and away from the best choice. \\n\\n**Exercise Frequency and Duration: Aim for 150 Minutes Per Week, Most Weeks**\\n\\nIf you are planning to start an exercise program for brain health, you might wonder how much exercise, how often, and for how long? Although there is some variability across studies, it appears that exercising for 150 minutes per week, at moderate intensity, provides significant benefit in both cognitive performance and in brain structure and functioning. Some studies involve fewer total minutes; for example, 20 minutes five times per week (100 minutes), or 30 minutes four times per week (120 minutes) have been reported in some studies that resulted in significantly larger brain volume and improved cognitive abilities. At the higher end of the scale, participants in one study exercised four times per week, 45-60 minutes per session (180-240 minutes total per week). However, not enough research has been conducted to conclude that exercising 240 minutes per week results in better brain health than 150 minutes per week. Unless you have a lot of free time on your hands, it is probably best to plan on around 150 minutes of exercise per week, nearly every week. And the kind of exercise would ideally be something you either enjoy or at least don't mind too much so that you will not have the urge to avoid or procrastinate instead of exercising. If you have a friend or family member who is interested in exercising, scheduling times to meet for exercise can help to keep you motivated and accountable. \\n\\n**Exercise Intensity**\\n\\nTo be effective, your exercise should be of moderate intensity. At a minimum, this could be a brisk walk, but more typically would involve jogging or bicycling at a rate that causes you to have to breathe harder, and causes your heart to beat faster. You can also use heart rate to calibrate your exercise intensity. Moderate intensity would be around 60% of your age-defined maximum heart rate. See the American Heart Association webpage for target heart rate. Your maximum heart rate, in beats per minute (bpm), can be roughly estimated by subtracting your age from 220. So, if you were 45 years old, for example, your maximum heart rate would be 220-45 = 175 beats per minute. Exercising at moderate intensity, or 60% of maximum heart rate, would have 175 bpm x 60% = 105 bpm as your target heart rate. \\n\\nThere is a relatively small amount of research indicating that higher intensity aerobic exercise, in the 75-85% range, may be more effective for brain health and cognitive fitness. However, there is not sufficient research evidence at this point to recommend higher intensity exercise rather than moderate intensity for brain health. And more importantly, if high-intensity exercise is experienced as so unpleasant that you end up quitting exercise, the potential benefits would be lost.\\n\\n**The Best Exercise Program**\\n\\nTaking into account the basic requirements for exercise, getting your heart rate and breathing up, and exercising at moderate intensity for about 150 minutes each week the best exercise program is the one you will stick with. Weight lifting appears to have less of a benefit in terms of brain health and cognitive functioning, but there is no reason to believe it is harmful. If you have sufficient time to engage in both aerobic exercise as well as weight lifting, there is no reason not to pursue both. Similarly, although yoga has health benefits in terms of physical toning and reduced stress, there is little evidence yet to conclude that it protects brain health or enhances cognitive functioning. However, if you have time to include yoga as well as an aerobic exercise program, there is no reason not to include both. \\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that planning a longer exercise program, or a higher-intensity program, is of no use if you cannot stick with it because it is too time-consuming or too unpleasant. And so, a very good starting point would be to aim for 150 minutes per week, at a moderate pace, following a schedule (3, 4, or 5 times per week) that you will be able to start and stick with for many years. Remember, the brain health and cognitive fitness benefits occur from continuing to exercise across time, and so sticking with regular exercise and making it a regular part of your lifestyle will be important.", "title": "What Type of Exercise, How Often, and for How Long?", "summary": "The strongest evidence for brain health and cognitive fitness by far is in support of regular aerobic exercise.

When you don’t have to get up at a specific time, it can be tempting to just remain in bed a little longer. Certainly, there is no need to get up at 4 AM for an early shift you no longer have. But staying in bed too long promotes negative mood, reduced energy, and irritability, and can interfere with getting to sleep at night. This can turn into an unhealthy cycle of disturbed sleep. If you go to bed at the same time most nights, it will be easier to fall asleep quickly and remain asleep most of the night. Getting out of bed at the same time most mornings will also make it easier to transition to wakefulness each morning, and help you feel energized and refreshed during the day.\\n\\nRetirement will provide more time to try out new activities or spend more time on favorite hobbies. There is plenty of opportunity for variety in terms of what you do. An important principle is trying to make sure that you set times to engage in meaningful, enjoyable, or even simply necessary activities each day. The reason this is important is that when you don’t have events or obligations scheduled at a specific time in the day, it can be easy to follow the path of least resistance in simply turning on TV, going online, or scrolling through your phone. While such days are not a problem every now and then, a pattern of passive disengaged behavior carries an increased risk for developing depression. Retirees are significantly happier, more satisfied, and healthier, when they make sure to schedule activities each day.\\n\\nThe range of activities to try is nearly endless – and this can actually become a problem. You could start thinking about whether to go golfing, meet friends for lunch, work in the yard, or go to the gym, but end up doing none of the above because of decision paralysis – a situation in which it becomes difficult to select one action because it requires giving up other attractive options. Although there may be a wide range of activities you could choose from, no one can do all possible activities.

Although, first responders often have very irregular schedules, to the extent that you are able to get 7-8 hours of undisturbed sleep at one time, your brain will likely be better off for doing so. It has been clearly established that cognitive performance suffers after a night of poor sleep. You are probably familiar with this if you have worked overnight shifts, or stayed up all night with friends as a teenager. Parents of infants are usually painfully familiar with the consequences of too little sleep after trying to coax a fussy baby to sleep in the middle of the night. The term \\"baby brain\\" refers to the forgetfulness, mental fogginess, and lack of concentration that frequently occur in sleep-deprived new parents. \\n\\nA night or two of poor sleep is not a big deal in the long run. However, the effects of sleeping poorly for weeks and months on end can have longer-lasting effects on brain health and cognitive performance. In fact, a number of studies have shown associations between sleep disturbance and known biological markers related to Alzheimer's disease. Disturbed sleep has been linked to increased buildup of amyloid beta, a substance that begins to accumulate in the brain in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, when sleep researchers interfere with normal sleep in experiments, they observe impairments in the slow-wave sleep patterns that are believed necessary to help clear the amyloid beta from the brain in healthy people. It is believed that having persistently disturbed sleep may allow this amyloid beta to build up, as is seen in Alzheimer's disease, and that this may interfere with healthy brain functioning and cause gradual cognitive decline. \\n\\n**Sleep Hygiene** \\n\\nThe Cordico app includes a module on sleep hygiene, which you can reference for more detail. However, the basic features are fairly simple:\\n\\n1.  Keep your sleep environment cool, dark, and quiet. Use earplugs if there is excessive noise, and use a fan if needed for cooling or for white noise. Blackout curtains can be especially helpful if you work overnight shifts.\\n2.  Try to maintain the same ritual before bedtime, and try to go to bed at the same time, as much as your schedule permits.\\n3.  Avoid caffeine 8 hours prior to bedtime. \\n4.  Keep electronics away from the bedroom; don't watch TV, or use your phone, or laptop in bed. Try to keep the bed associated only with sleep, so that the bed does not serve as a cue to be awake and alert.\\n5.  Give yourself enough time to get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. If it takes a while to fall asleep, build this into your schedule so that you have time to fall asleep, and then get the 8 hours of sleep.\\n\\n**Sleep Apnea**\\n\\nWhile there are many useful sleep hygiene techniques that can reduce insomnia and other problems with getting enough sleep, sleep apnea is a special case of sleep disorder that requires additional interventions. Sleep apnea occurs when someone stops breathing (apnea), or significantly reduces their breathing rate (hypopnea) during sleep. Sleep apnea causes a temporary reduction in oxygen in the blood. Although any single incident of stopped breathing has virtually no harmful effects, many people with sleep apnea stop breathing dozens or hundreds of times per night. The cumulative effect of oxygen deprivation can become very significant, and in fact, can be life-threatening. Individuals with untreated sleep apnea have a significantly lower expected life span than those without sleep apnea. \\n\\nThe harmful effects of sleep apnea on brain health occur primarily because of the repetitive episodes of hypoxia, or inadequate oxygen to the brain. Any single episode of apnea has very minimal effect, but tens of thousands of apnea episodes, several per hour, night after night and month after month, can cause damage and even death to the neurons that make up our brain. Because of this, significant cognitive decline is typically observed in people with untreated sleep apnea.\\n\\nAlthough sleep apnea should be formally diagnosed by a sleep specialist, there are several warning signs that sleep apnea may be present. These include: \\n\\n*   Snoring\\n*   Waking up gasping for air, or feeling as if you were suffocating. Feeling excessively sleepy during the day even after sleeping 7 or more hours\\n*   Having someone witness you stopping breathing during sleep.\\n\\nIf any of these signs have been present, it is strongly recommended that you consult with your physician and describe your concerns about possible sleep apnea. You may be referred for a sleep study to see whether any sleep problems are present. Fortunately, if sleep apnea is present, there are a number of highly effective solutions that would likely significantly improve your sleep quality. Successfully treating sleep apnea, if present, can have a major impact on your daily cognitive functioning, allowing you to concentrate more effectively and for longer durations, and enhancing your ability to learn and retain new information. For those suffering from undetected sleep apnea, effective treatment can be a real game-changer in terms of overall wellness, particularly for enhancing and maintaining cognitive fitness.", "title": "Adequate Sleep", "summary": "There is some research indicating that chronic sleep deprivation can affect memory, concentration, and other cognitive abilities, and may also be harmful to brain functioning.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-20 20:35:15.902152+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:03:00.933954+00	\N	f

Alcohol is a neurotoxin, meaning that elevated levels of alcohol in the bloodstream causes neurons to deteriorate or die. When alcohol is consumed at levels of 3 or more drinks per day for men, or 2 or more drinks per day for women, there is a significantly increased likelihood of brain atrophy. \\n\\nExcessive alcohol use has been firmly established as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Although some studies have suggested that moderate alcohol intake (2 or fewer servings of red wine per day for men, 1 or fewer servings for women) may protect against dementia, there are a number of other studies indicating that any level of alcohol increases the likelihood of dementia. Alcohol is known to be neurotoxic, and so any potential benefits to the cardiovascular system from small amounts of alcohol may be entirely offset by the harmful effects that alcohol has when it contacts brain cells. While moderate amounts of alcohol as described above may have either minimal or no negative effects on brain health, it is clear that higher intake of alcohol has harmful effects on the brain: The more alcohol consumed, the greater the degree of lost brain tissue, and the greater the impairment in memory, concentration, and other cognitive abilities.\\n\\nIt is reasonable to consider eliminating alcohol from your daily life, consuming alcohol only moderately during occasional social gatherings. While the perceived enjoyment of drinking beer or other alcoholic beverages may make it seem difficult to cut this out of your daily life, it can be surprisingly easy to replace a drink with some other enjoyable, relaxing, or engaging activity. Researchers have often found that when people rate their enjoyment of a drink in the moment, they actually enjoy it much less than they anticipate they will enjoy it. And so, drinking alcohol may not actually be as enjoyable as people assume it will be. If so, then replacing having two or three beers after work with something that is truly enjoyable would likely not be very difficult. And doing so would almost certainly enhance brain health, and help you to maintain long-term cognitive fitness.

Burnout is also associated with working more hours per week, and with handling more paperwork. Generally, burnout is more likely when the demands of the job are high, but the sense of job control is low in terms of scheduling or the type of work assignments. In addition, if the day-to-day activities on the job seem unrelated to the motivations that led you to pursue law enforcement as a career, the disconnect between what you do at work and your deeply held values can lead to dissatisfaction and further contribute to burnout. In the case described earlier, Jerome started off well but began receiving criticism from his supervisor and from members of the public, which seemed completely unfair to him. Being criticized for his actions while at the same time being physically hurt by a suspect seemed especially unfair. Like most people, Jerome finds the paperwork especially tedious, and he has begun to dread spending time filling out forms and reports. The lack of control over his schedule has also been difficult because he often ends up being away from his family and feels tired and irritable when he does get to see them. Given that he entered law enforcement to stop bad guys and protect the public, the paper-pushing and other tedious tasks seem less and less meaningful.

When these factors are not addressed, they may gradually erode life satisfaction and the ability to work effectively. The following guidelines can help you identify ways to avoid compassion fatigue. \\n\\n**Adequate Self-Care**\\n\\nIt is important to ensure that you regularly get enough time off work so that you can give yourself a period of distance and relief from the stressors of work. Self-care includes getting regular exercise, reserving time to spend with family and friends, and protecting time for adequate sleep. For some, self-care may include working on hobbies or playing team sports. Others may be rejuvenated by periods of unstructured time for reflection or rest. Although first responder's schedules are often very demanding, it is important to intentionally plan for enjoyable or satisfying activities when not on duty. These may involve reading, watching movies, yard work, going out to dinner, cooking, traveling, and so on. The important element is to intentionally plan for these activities to ensure that fatigue or inactivity do not keep you from these self-care activities.\\n\\n**Address Unresolved Trauma Exposure**\\n\\nFirst responders may be vicariously exposed to trauma numerous times while on duty. Some may also have experienced traumatic events before becoming a first responder. Although for some the effects of traumatic exposure will resolve naturally, others will continue to be bothered by unwanted memories or nightmares of the trauma or may have excessive feelings of guilt, anger, or mistrust that cause problems in interactions with co-workers or members of the public. Taking time to process these traumatic events, either with a peer support member or behavioral health trauma specialist, can clear away the effects of the unresolved trauma, and help prevent compassion fatigue from developing. \\n\\n**Keep a High Positive-to-Negative Ratio**\\n\\nStudies indicate that people who are functioning at a high-level report experiencing positive emotions significantly more often than negative emotions. In one study, a 3 to 1 ratio for the frequency of experiencing positive versus negative emotions was associated with excellent function in work, relationships, and life satisfaction. A similar ratio applies to functioning effectively with co-workers (as well as marital relationships). A ratio of 5 positive interactions to every 1 negative interaction was associated with very strong levels of work productivity and interpersonal functioning.\\n\\nThese findings suggest that your risk for compassion fatigue may be reduced by actively seeking ways to promote positive emotions throughout the day. You can do so by intentionally seeking interactions or activities that usually brighten your mood. And when you are unable to change circumstances as you might like, you can still create positive emotions by actively looking for things to appreciate in your current situation. This could include looking for opportunities to appreciate success in one's own work, enjoying your environment (a visual feature of a landscape or cityscape that you never noticed before), or an admirable characteristic of a colleague or member of the public.\\n\\n**Seeking Elevation**\\n\\nShifting your attention to the positive in others can give you an increased emotional positive-to-negative ratio. As you intentionally seek to notice the admirable characteristics of others, you may have the experience of \\"elevation.\\" This refers to a positive, warm emotional response that occurs when we see others demonstrating moral beauty or behaving virtuously. Examples include the humbling and inspiring feelings experienced when we see others behaving heroically, honorably, selflessly, or in services of others. Experiencing elevation motivates us to help others and connect with them, and creates powerful positive emotions. An important result of experiencing elevation is that it promotes an increased desire to be helpful and to care for those in distress; in other words, it can help to prevent or reverse compassion fatigue.", "title": "Addressing Compassion Fatigue", "summary": "Researchers have identified factors that appear to be associated with compassion fatigue.

By reviewing the psychological research, he determined the important questions to ask when we wish to isolate a cue from the backdrop of unimportant and distracting information. Based on the research, Duhigg discovered five key questions to ask yourself when isolating the cue that triggers a habit loop. Ask yourself these five questions when you experience the urge to engage in a habit:\\n\\n1.  Where are you? \\n2.  What time is it? \\n3.  What's your emotional state? \\n4.  Who else is around? \\n5.  What action preceded the urge?\\n\\nAfter a few sequences of examining your habit, the first elements of a pattern should begin to emerge. For example, does the urge strike repeatedly at a particular time of day? At a certain location? When you're experiencing a specific emotion? When someone particular (or no one at all) is around? Or following some specific other behavior or event? \\n\\n**Key Point:** By analyzing the patterns revealed by these five questions, you'll be on the path to isolating the cue from the background noise.", "title": "Step Three: Isolate the Cue", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 22:09:43.021665+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:56:49.768542+00	\N	f

Although there is some variability, for most adults this would mean 7-8 hours of sleep per night. When one sleeps significantly less than 7-8 hours, all important areas of human functioning are affected. Cognitive abilities including attention, concentration, and learning efficiency are impaired following even a single night of sleep restriction. Emotional effects of sleep deprivation include increased irritability, negative mood, and stronger emotional reactivity to stressors. Physically, sleep deprivation is associated with increased lethargy, feelings of fatigue, and reduced energy, with reduced ability to persist at tasks.\\n\\nA single night of poor sleep results in these negative consequences for most people. When there is a pattern of inadequate sleep, the functioning of the immune system becomes compromised, and the risk of infectious illnesses increases significantly.

Some substances tend to lower arousal, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines, like Xanax, Ativan, or Valium. Others increase arousal and may create a temporary feeling of excitement and energy, such as cocaine or methamphetamines. Marijuana and LSD change perceptual experiences, while opioids such as prescription pain medications (oxycontin, oxycodone), or heroin or morphine, produce temporary euphoria as well as numbing and dulling senses. These are described in greater detail below.\\n\\n**Alcohol**\\n\\nA standard drink includes 0.6 fluid ounces of pure alcohol. In the US, this would be equivalent to a 12 oz. beer, 8-9 fluid oz of malt liquor, a 5 oz glass of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounce shot of a distilled spirit such as whiskey, rum, vodka, or gin.\\n\\nConsuming too much alcohol leads to intoxication, which can include slurred speech, unsteady gait when walking, talking more loudly, and feeling sleepy. Intoxication can also lead to verbal or physical aggression, vomiting, or passing out.\\n\\nIf someone uses too much alcohol over time, they have an increased risk of stroke, higher rates of cancer and liver disease, and significantly increased risk of harm from accidents. Alcohol use is involved in 60% of drownings and murders, 50% of significant injuries, around half of sexual assaults, and around 40% of fatal motor vehicle accidents. The risk of suicide is significantly increased when someone is using alcohol.\\n\\nAlcohol is also toxic to brain cells, and excessive use over time may result in smaller brain size because of damage to these brain cells. This can result in problems with memory and with learning new information.\\n\\n**Benzodiazepines**\\n\\nPrescription medications such as Xanax, Valium, and Ativan are often prescribed to reduce anxiety in people with excessive worry, or who are experiencing panic attacks. However, with prolonged use, the brain quickly becomes accustomed to the presence of the drug, so that more of the substance is required to maintain the same anxiety-reducing effect. This is called \\"tolerance\\". At the same time, if the person stops using the drug, the absence of the drug in their system may lead to unpleasant anxiety, tremors, or other \\"withdrawal\\" symptoms. Benzodiazepines can produce a temporary state of pleasurable mood, which leads some people to misuse them for this \\"high\\". During benzodiazepine use people generally have lower anxiety, but they also experience significantly slowed physical reaction time, and slower thinking processes. As a result, their risk for an accident while driving increases significantly.\\n\\n**Cocaine**\\n\\nCocaine is a stimulant drug, and has a high risk for abuse and addiction. It may be snorted into the nose, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through the nasal membranes. Because cocaine is illegal, the contents of cocaine from a drug dealer are not regulated, and so it may have been mixed with a number of additives such as flour or talcum powder to increase profits; it may also be mixed with other controlled substances, such as amphetamines, or with opioids such as fentanyl. Fentanyl is a very powerful opioid, and can cause death by suppressing breathing in very small doses. As such, users of cocaine may be at risk when they are unaware of the contents of the substance they are using.\\n\\nWhile cocaine is generally inhaled nasally, it can also be dissolved into a solution and injected into the bloodstream. When combined with heroin, this injected combination is called a speedball. As with fentanyl, the possibility of suppressed breathing caused by the heroin can lead to respiratory failure and death. Cocaine may also be smoked in a crystallized form (crack cocaine), which tends to produce a more rapid high.\\n\\nCocaine affects the amount of dopamine available in the reward area of the brain. Cocaine blocks dopamine from being recycled, and leaves more of it available to activate neurons in this reward area. However, with prolonged use, the brain circuits adapt to the increased dopamine activity by becoming less reactive to dopamine, so that increasingly larger amounts of cocaine are required for the same effect. This can lead to significant psychological and medical harm, including overdose leading to heart attack, seizure, or stroke. Some people may develop hallucinations or delusions as a result of prolonged use.\\n\\n**Heroin and Opioid Pain Medications**\\n\\nHeroin is an opioid derived from morphine. Morphine has been used for decades for pain control. It is extracted from opium poppy plants. Heroin is produced by further processing morphine into a powder form. Heroin can be liquefied and injected, or can be snorted nasally, or smoked. Heroin rapidly affects the opioid receptor cells in several brain areas, initially producing both pain relief and increased pleasure. Some of the affected brain areas control heart rate, breathing, and sleep; heroin slows respiration and heart rate, and causes drowsiness.\\n\\nProlonged use of heroin causes insomnia, vein abnormalities for intravenous users, intestinal abnormalities, and increased risk of injection related infection. In addition, additives often found in heroin, such as starch or powdered milk, can obstruct blood vessels and cause permanent damage to organs, including liver, lungs, and brain. Shared needle use also dramatically increases the risk of HIV and hepatitis. Heroin overdose is common, primarily due to decreased breathing rate that leads to hypoxia. This can cause gradual death of brain tissue, with repeated hypoxia. However, breathing may also stop entirely as a result of heroin overdose, leading to death from hypoxia.\\n\\nOpioid prescription medications are derived from the opium poppy plant, or are synthesized in the lab to produce a similar chemical structure. These medications produce relaxation as well as pain relief, but can also produce a \\"high\\", leading some to abuse them recreationally. All of the opioids are highly addictive, and it is quite easy to die from overdose from these medications.\\n\\nThe opioids include hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet), oxymorphone (Opana), morphine, codeine, and fentanyl. Although these medications are generally safe when used for a short time and prescribed by a physician, patients can quickly become dependent if they taking the medication more frequently than prescribed, or at higher doses, or for longer periods than prescribed. In addition, crushing a pill to snort or inject the substance creates a rapid high, rather than the time-release pain control, and this misuse promotes rapid dependence (addiction).\\n\\nOpioids can have many negative medical effects, including drowsiness, confusions, constipation, and slowed breathing. Most dangerous of these is the slowed breathing, which can lead to hypoxia (inadequate oxygen reaching the brain). This can produce gradual brain damage across time, but can also lead to the cessation of breathing and death.\\n\\n**Marijuana**\\n\\nMarijuana (also called cannabis, pot, weed) is the most frequently used illicit drug in the United States. Marijuana may be smoked or may be mixed into foods, such as brownies or cookies, and eaten (\\"edibles\\"). The psychoactive component of marijuana, THC, may be extracted and smoked or eaten.\\n\\nWhen smoked, marijuana is quickly transported to the brain, and effects are felt within minutes. When eaten, the effects of marijuana may not be felt for 30 to 60 minutes. The effects include alterations in sensory perceptions, such as enhanced taste, smells or more intense colors; altered time perception, such that time seems to move more slowly, and significant changes in cognition. In particular, marijuana interferes with memory, thinking, and problem-solving. At high doses, marijuana can produce hallucinations or delusions.\\n\\nLong-term use of marijuana can lead to significant impairment in brain development in adolescents and teenagers, and these effects may be permanent. In one study conducted in New Zealand, those who began using marijuana heavily as teenagers had a loss of 8 IQ points from ages 13 to 38, and the loss in IQ did not completely return to normal even in those who stopped using marijuana as adults. At the same time, if marijuana use started in adulthood, no significant drop in IQ was observed.\\n\\nProlonged marijuana use is associated with respiratory problems, including bronchitis. It is unclear whether smoking marijuana causes an increased risk of lung cancer. Marijuana has also been associated with psychological problems, such as paranoia, disorganized thoughts, depression, and anxiety. Regular use of marijuana is associated with reduced life satisfaction, reduced physical health, poorer relationship functioning, mental health difficulties, and lower educational and academic achievement. \\n\\n**Methamphetamine**\\n\\nMethamphetamine is a stimulant that is among the most highly addictive of all substances. Other terms for methamphetamine or crystal, speed, meth, and ice. It may be smoked, snorted, swallowed as a pill, or injected after dissolving in a solution. Methamphetamine affects the availability of dopamine in the brain, especially in areas associated with reward. Although cocaine is similar in its effects, methamphetamine has a stronger reinforcing effect on drug use behavior, and so has greater potential for addiction.\\n\\nIn the short-term, methamphetamines increase alertness, suppress appetite, increase blood pressure, and reduce appetite There is also greater motivation for physical activity. In the long-term, methamphetamine use leads to addiction, extreme and permanent tooth damage, increased anxiety, problems with thinking, including confusion and memory loss, and persistent changes in brain structure and functioning. Prolonged use also leads to aggression, sleep disturbance, and psychotic symptoms including paranoia and hallucinations.\\n\\nMethamphetamine overdose can result in death as a result of heart attack, stroke, or organ failure. The risk of death from using methamphetamine is increased by the presence of additives, such as fentanyl or other opioids in the methamphetamine.\\n\\nWithdrawal from methamphetamine is associated with highly unpleasant experiences including severe depression, intense craving for the drug, anxiety, fatigue; in some cases, psychosis may occur.", "title": "Types of Drugs", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 19:45:34.114027+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:12:31.189677+00	\N	f

Normally, we progress from wakefulness to differing levels of sleep, some shallower and some very deep. It is during the deeper stages of sleep that we experience greater rest and memory consolidation, and this allows us to feel refreshed on waking. Those with sleep apnea stop breathing dozens or even hundreds of times while asleep. This causes them to return to near-wakefulness repeatedly throughout the night and prevents them from progressing into the deep stages of sleep that are necessary for adequate rest. As a result, they may sleep 8 or more hours, but awake feeling exhausted, and experiencing abnormally severe and persistent daytime sleepiness. Sleep apnea may be present in someone who snores excessively, who has been repeatedly witnessed with stopped breathing during sleep, and who has persistent daytime sleepiness despite sufficient sleep duration (7-8 hours). In addition to causing irritability, feelings of fatigue and concentration difficulties, untreated sleep apnea can lead to serious health consequences, including increased risk of accidents from falling asleep while driving.

Sounding distraught he declared \\"Asher is dead!\\" referring to another squad member of ours and an academy classmate and friend of mine. Immediately my thoughts turned to Asher being shot and killed in the line of duty. Police Suicide never crossed my mind, why would it? This man was a six-year veteran of our agency and a decorated U.S. Marine; so many thoughts, many unanswered questions. The next morning, the headline in the Sun Sentinel newspaper read: \\n\\n**PINES OFFICER KILLS HIMSELF IN HIS CRUISER** \\n\\nJust before sunrise, Police Officer Asher Rosinsky parked his cruiser along the edge of the Florida Everglades, and alone in the darkness, he held his .40-caliber semiautomatic duty weapon to his chest, and then pulled the trigger. A fellow officer and friend of mine observed the parked cruiser and found Asher dead with one bullet hole center mass. How could this have happened? Why didn't we see the red flags that, in reflection, were right in front of our eyes? What could I have done to prevent this from occurring? Why didn't he just reach out before taking this drastic and devastating action? This man was married and had two young sons; one was three and the other just 18 months. \\n\\nWhat ensued in the days after will prove to have the most profound impact on my professional career. So what occurred immediately afterward that was so impactful? NOTHING. Asher was buried the next day and as in any traditional Jewish burial ceremony; we all took turns grabbing a shovel and literally proceeded to bury our brother in blue, by shoveling the dirt onto his casket. No big fanfare, no well-publicized traditional police memorial service, NOTHING. When we returned to work it was business as usual, \\"25 Alpha 4, I'm 10-08.\\" I mean, we are mentally tough warriors, sworn to protect and serve, what would we need? NOTHING!\\n\\nBack in those days, Peer Support, CISM, Critical Incident Stress Debriefings, or EAP programs weren't really a part of the law enforcement landscape. If you needed assistance or wanted to speak to someone, you were considered weak or maybe even unfit to be an officer. EAP, you mean \\"Expose and Punish,\\" no thank you, I'm not getting labeled or sent to the \\"Rubber-Gun Squad.\\" \\n\\nFast forward to 2019, so much technology, so much awareness, yet more officers still die by suicide than all other \\"in the line-of-duty\\" deaths combined. The numbers are staggering and the experts estimate the numbers are being under-reported by up to a factor of 2.5. These numbers fail to even address our retired brothers and sisters, or support staff such as dispatchers, crime scene techs, etc. Something drastic needs to be implemented to stop this epidemic from continuing. Every 44... A recent study discovered that every 44 hours an officer dies by suicide. \\n\\nThen it happened, an epiphany. I was blessed with an introduction to Dr. David Black, President and Founder of Cordico. Dr. Black was presenting his CordicoShield Officer Wellness App; a tool that would provide 24/7/365 access to powerful resources right at our employees' fingertips with total anonymity and confidentiality. Finally, something of merit that targets solution, not just addresses the problem and as Chief John Carli of the Vacaville Police Department stated, \\"This is a game-changer, and there's nothing else like it.\\"\\n\\nIn April, I traveled to New York City to attend the Police Executive Research Forum Symposium on Law Enforcement Suicide, hosted by the NYPD. The symposium was very well attended with over 350 attendees. from all over the world; from subject matter experts to practitioners to law enforcement executives. \\n\\nFinally, these conversations are being brought out from the shadows and into the open. So much great work and effort is being done in the area of officer wellness. As a result of the symposium, there were many great takeaways; the most impactful for me, the need to have a multifaceted approach for any chance of being impactful and successful. We must have a call to action, a paradigm switch; where innovative, action-focused, problem solvers take a stand to focus on solutions and not just address, or raise awareness, of the problem. We need partners who are willing to make a concerted effort in creating a culture of wellness within our organizations. Create an environment of, \\"it's OK, to not be OK\\"; along with the multifaceted approach that provides resources from all angles and targets solutions. \\n\\nAt the Pinole Police Department, we developed the \\"Asher Model - A Seven Point Approach to Creating a Culture of Wellness.\\" This was developed as a multifaceted approach to the police suicide epidemic; it correlates to the seven-point star badge that is worn in the Bay Area and each of the seven points on the star correlates to a point in our proactive approach to employee wellness. We feel the most crucial point in our model is providing our employees with the **CordicoShield Employee Wellness App.**", "title": "Introduction", "summary": "It's the early morning hours of May 2nd, 1993 and I was awoken by the jarring sound of the phone ringing; on the other end was a friend of mine and fellow squad member.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-22 13:23:29.554367+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:26:08.202011+00	\N	f

Many people have described grief as arriving like a wave; they will feel relatively normal for a period, and then have a powerful surge of intense longing and loss sweep over them. During these times they may feel nearly overwhelmed by the intensity of the grief. They describe a physical ache for the loved one, with a nearly desperate desire to reconnect with them. They may feel a sense of emptiness or hollowness, as though the relationship with the loved one had been pulled from them physically. And then, the way water recedes from the beach after a wave has crashed on the shore, the intense emotions fade.\\n\\nUnlike ocean waves, the waves of grief are not so predictable or regular. They often seem to come out of the blue, with no warning. They may also be triggered by reminders of the loved one, such as when a favorite song comes on the radio, or when seeing someone who looks like them, or being reminded of future plans you may have made together, or seeing their favorite item on a menu. The potential reminders for triggering grief are as numerous as the experiences you shared with the loved one, and initially it may seem as though the painful emotions will never fade.

First responders are exposed to a wide range of stressful events on the job including responding to dangerous calls, dealing with high-risk individuals, managing threats to safety, and witnessing both violence and the aftermath of violence. Other more mundane sources of stress on the job include heavy workloads, looming deadlines, interpersonal differences with co-workers, as well as simply managing the deluge of emails and interruptions that many face. On top of workplace stressors, dealing with commuting, traffic, and the steady demands of home life can create persistent levels of elevated stress. The emotional effects of stress are obvious - it is very unpleasant to feel consistently pressured and in crisis mode. Less obvious, however, are the physical effects of prolonged stress. During stress, muscles tense, promoting headaches and backache; the digestive system is affected, leading in some cases to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Prolonged stress weakens our immune system, making us more vulnerable to colds, influenza, and other infectious disease. Blood pressure increases under stress, and in some people this can progress to hypertension, which can cause numerous additional medical complications, including stroke and cardiovascular disease.

It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.\\n\\nSome forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as:\\n\\n*   **Persistent depressive disorder** (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder.\\n*   **Perinatal depression** is much more serious than the “baby blues” (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with perinatal depression experience full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany perinatal depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies.\\n*   **Psychotic depression** occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations). The psychotic symptoms typically have a depressive “theme,” such as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness.\\n*   **Seasonal affective disorder** is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months when there is less natural sunlight. This depression generally lifts during spring and summer. Winter depression, typically accompanied by social withdrawal, increased sleep, and weight gain, predictably returns every year in seasonal affective disorder.\\n*   [**Bipolar disorder**](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml) is different from depression, but it is included in this list is because someone with bipolar disorder experiences episodes of extremely low moods that meet the criteria for major depression (called “bipolar depression”).

While many people are not naturally optimistic, in recent years there have been exciting developments in developing a lasting optimistic attitude. Martin Seligman, a prominent psychology researcher, has shown that when people are asked to record their thoughts in different situations, they can train themselves through repeated practice to identify and strengthen more positive, optimistic ways of viewing situations. Further, these exercises can generalize across different situations, so that if someone develops greater optimism in their work life, for example, they are also more likely to become optimistic in their social life or in pursuing fitness goals.\\n\\nOne reason that developing an optimistic perspective is worth the effort is that those who are especially optimistic tend to persist at goals that they set for themselves, and are significantly more likely to see their goals through to completion. The result across time is a significantly higher record of success and accomplishment.\\n\\nAnother reason for working at increasing your optimism is that optimists are both healthier and happier. Even those who tend to see the downside of every situation, and anticipate the worse, can make persistent changes in the ways that they think about situations that can shift them from being pessimists to optimists, with the positive benefits associated with optimism.\\n\\nThe thought-changing techniques described earlier are relevant here as well. Generally, the first step involves noticing when you feel pessimistic, discouraged, or sad, and then trying to notice what thought was going through your mind. After writing this thought down, notice what effect this kind of thought may have been having on you. For example, if you have been trying to learn a new software program, and find that you are feeling discouraged, you may notice that you were thinking, \\"I'll never learn this; I'm just not smart enough.\\" Notice also what effect this thought might have on your behavior; are you more likely, or less likely, to persist at learning the program? Most people are more prone to giving up when they have such thoughts. Next, consider how you might dispute this negative thought. Is there reasonable evidence against this belief (e.g., you may have completed difficult courses in college, or learned another difficult program in the past)? If the belief is partially true, what would be the implications (e.g., you may be able to learn the program with help from an expert; would that be an effective solution?). If you are unable to decide on whether the evidence does or doesn't support a negative belief, you can consider the advantages and disadvantages of holding the negative belief versus taking a different, more positive belief. \\n\\n**Finally, as before, you can ask yourself the two questions:** \\n\\n1.

If you are a law enforcement officer, the valuable insights in this book could potentially save your life. His book puts into words many of the distressing and confusing experiences that law enforcement officers accumulate during their careers. Dr. Gilmartin's 20-year career as a sheriff's deputy gives him an insider's perspective on the daily life of an officer, including the harmful effects this work can have on officers and their families. Importantly, this book describes not only the path that leads many officers to cynicism, relationship failures, and burnout; but also principles for avoiding these. He describes the behaviors, habits, and ways of thinking that allow officers to thrive and remain resilient across decades in this challenging career. \\n\\nFor new officers, it may seem surprising that \\"emotional survival\\" would be considered an important skill. After all, the experience of going through the rigors of police academy with other enthusiastic and idealistic candidates tends to strengthen one's identity as a law enforcement officer and strengthens one's core values of service to others and protection of one's community. In the early years of a career in police work, the risks of the job tend to intensify one's emotions and usually create a feeling of intense engagement and a \\"rush\\" while on duty. Many officers feel a sense of excitement and enthusiasm about their role - they love being a cop. So with so much enthusiasm for the job, why would an officer need to be concerned about emotional survival? \\n\\nAlthough the dangers of being a police officer increase the risk of physical harm, the emotional harm that this career can cause is much more common and can have devastating consequences. In fact, the suicide rate for police officers is four times greater than the risk of dying feloniously in the line of duty, and three times greater than the rate of suicide in the civilian population. Similarly, the divorce rate for police officers is significantly higher than in the general population. Many law enforcement officers begin to suffer physical and medical problems after years on the job, due to poor diet, inadequate sleep, and a lack of regular exercise. In addition, psychological problems, including depression and PTSD, can take a toll on the officer and his or her family. There is a clear need for effective tools for officers to cope with the toll that this career can take on their emotional life and on their important relationships. Dr. Gilmartin's book describes many such tools, along with two primary concepts that stand at the core of the book. First, an explanation of the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster, a concept developed by Dr. Gilmartin, describes in clear detail an experience that will be familiar to officers but that they may not have been able to put into words. In this description, Dr. Gilmartin explains the biological basis for alternating between the rush of excitement while on duty and the apathy and disengagement associated with being off duty. This is a critically important concept, because the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster's harmful effects on officers' physical health, mental well-being, and relationships with family members are very common and highly predictable. \\n\\nThe second important concept in Dr. Gilmartin's book is that officers can prevent the negative consequences of the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster by aggressively and proactively taking charge of their off-duty personal lives. He details the differences between police officers who survive and thrive in their careers, maintaining good relationships and good physical and mental health; and those who become cynical, give in to a \\"victim\\" mentality, and watch passively as their relationships disintegrate and their emotional and physical health deteriorate. Dr. Gilmartin's book provides vivid descriptions of veteran police officers who started their careers with enthusiasm and energy, only to end up after years on the force cynical about the job, divorced, and alienated from family and friends. Fortunately, Dr. Gilmartin also describes veteran officers whose paths went in a different direction; officers who retained their core values in their work, and whose relationships became deeper and stronger with time. The crucial difference has to do with the deliberate steps that these successful veteran police officers took to deal head-on with the demands of police work, and the strategies that they have used to keep themselves mentally and physically strong, spiritually healthy, and closely connected with loved ones.", "title": "Overview of Emotional Survival", "summary": "Dr. Gilmartin's landmark book, Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement: A Guide for Officers and Their Families, has been read by countless public safety professionals.

Cognitive reappraisal involves looking at a distressing situation from different perspectives, reducing the negative emotions and tension that we experience. For example, if you are running late driving to a meeting, you may be thinking, \\"I'm so irresponsible! Everyone will think I'm incompetent for being late!\\" As a result of these thoughts, you would likely be feeling tense, and angry with yourself. Cognitive reappraisal would involve reinterpreting the situation in a realistic but helpful way. For example, \\"Being a few minutes late every now and then is completely normal and has nothing to do with being competent.\\"\\n\\nIn addition, many of us often have automatic thoughts or interpretations that cause feelings of stress or anxiety, even though the beliefs or interpretations may not be accurate. One simple cognitive technique is to notice when we feel a sharp increase in feeling stressed, and then ask, \\"What was going through my mind?\\" just before feeling stressed, and then writing down those thoughts. We can then examine the thoughts objectively, weigh the evidence for them, and ask, \\"What's another way of thinking about this?\\".

0546441f-39fe-42d5-90ed-4f1ebd56515e	LE - Emotional Survival (Dr. Gilmartin) - Being a Survivor 	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Being a Survivor**\\n\\n\\nOfficers who develop a survivor mentality, rather than a victim mentality, recognize that they can and must be in charge of their personal time as much as possible. Dr. Gilmartin's book describes in more detail the characteristics of a survivor orientation, which are summarized below.\\n\\n**Aggressive Personal Time Management**\\n\\nDr. Gilmartin emphasizes that being an emotional survivor means becoming an aggressive personal time manager. Police work should not be 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for an officer, and personal time should be valued and used in ways that enhance relationships and quality of life. Being aggressive about personal time management means planning, in advance, what one is going to do while off-duty to nurture and cultivate the valued relationships and activities that are unrelated to police work. Waiting until going off-duty and hoping that a good idea for family time will spring to mind is rarely successful because officers at the low level of the roller coaster have reduced decision-making ability and reduced motivation to engage in such activities. \\n\\n**Recognizing the Effects of the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster**\\n\\nOfficers should be taught to recognize the feeling of being drained after work as a consequence of hypervigilance and realize in advance that this effect will interfere with being able to get excited about planning off-duty activities with family or friends. Because of this, officers with a survivor orientation know in advance that when they go off-duty they will feel lethargic, and will want to mentally \\"check out,\\" without needing to think. They realize that they won't be as effective at making decisions or setting up plans, at these times. They recognize that in order to take control of their personal lives, they will need to become proactive by planning for time with family and friends well before going off duty.\\n\\n\\"_Survivors control what is taking place in their personal lives and realize they are not controlling most of the events taking place at the police agency. By controlling their personal time, they turn off police work and turn on personal life._\\"\\n\\n**Making Time Rather than Finding Time**\\n\\nBusy officers will never \\"find\\" time to do valued activities in their personal lives; extra time does not miraculously appear. Instead, officers who are survivors make the time by setting down in advance in their calendar the activities that are important and valued. This can include a date night with a spouse every two weeks, going to a kid's basketball game, meeting non-work friends for dinner, exercising, or doing volunteer work. Survivor officers don't wait until going off duty to think about plans - with a proactive time control orientation, the survivor officer looks days ahead for enjoyable activities, discusses these with their spouse, family, or friends to reach a decision, and then places it on the calendar. Once on the calendar, the survivor looks forward to a meaningful activity that is under their control.\\n\\n_\\"The victim officer looks forward to taking his or her children camping 'when things slow down at work. The survivor officer looks forward to taking his or her children camping two weekends from now. Which officer do you think actually takes the children camping - the vague victim or the specific survivor?'\\"_\\n\\n**Being Realistic About Unexpected Work Demands**\\n\\nOf course, police work often involves unexpected interruptions, such as a last-minute overtime requirement, or a change in assignments, that may cause plans to be canceled. This is a reality of the job, and it triggers sharply different responses from officers with a survivor mentality compared to those with a victim mentality. Dr. Gilmartin writes that, if asked how often the agency actually interferes with their plans, victim officers will respond, \\"All the time. Every time I make plans, they screw me over.\\" Survivors, on the other hand, give a more honest and realistic estimate; \\"Oh, 20 or 30% of the time they screw up my plans.\\" These different responses engage very different emotions (cynical bitterness versus mild disappointment), and very different attitudes toward the job. These different ways of thinking about and responding to negative work experiences can have important consequences for job satisfaction and performance, for emotional health, and for relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.\\n\\nOfficers with a victim mentality begin early in their career to combine a sense of disappointment over the agency causing their plans to be canceled, with the passive state of \\"checking out\\" and flipping channels when off duty. As a result, officers with a victim mentality cease to aggressively and proactively control their personal lives. Instead of recognizing the reality that the majority of their personal plans are not canceled, they take a victim orientation toward their personal time, believing that if they make any plans the department will \\"screw\\" them out of it by changing their schedule. This victim mentality may lead them to make no meaningful plans for weeks or months at a time - or longer. As a result, they may waste hundreds or thousands of hours staring at a screen rather than engaging in meaningful activities with those they care about. \\n\\n_\\"One of the basic reasons the personal lives of many police officers are lost is not due to a conscious effort to cease engaging in off-duty activities, but rather to a loss of a sense of control of the time to do the activities.\\"_\\n\\n**Maintaining a Focus on Effectiveness**\\n\\nPolice officers with a survivor mentality focus on being in charge of running their lives each day. In contrast, those with a victim mentality maintain a sense of having been wronged and mistreated and focus their thoughts and energy on retribution or retaliation against the agency or individual they believed wronged them. Survivor officers acknowledge that they may be \\"screwed\\" sometimes by the agency, but they set this aside, ignore what they cannot control, and focus on being effective in their daily actions, both while on duty and in their personal lives. They don't waste time obsessing over perceived wrongs by the agency, but instead determinedly attempt to live life fully, proactively coping with the effects of the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster by aggressively managing their personal time, and preventing the effects of the roller coaster from progressing into cynicism and the victim mentality.\\n\\n**Survivors Exercise Regularly**\\n\\nThe Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster is a physiological process, and coping effectively with it requires some degree of physiological intervention. Whereas the lower parts of the roller coaster involve depressive-like lethargy, physical exercise helps to bring the police officer back into a normal range both physiologically and emotionally. Because exercise counteracts off-duty passivity that often has the officer flipping channels for hours on end, after exercising the officer can become more energized, more interested in interacting with family and friends, and ready to engage in meaningful activities. \\n\\nAlthough most officers are already aware of the benefits of exercise, some officers may be resistant or find it difficult to start a regular exercise routine. One of the many benefits of exercise is that while working out, the demands of police work are set aside for a period, and the officer has complete control of his own behavior. After exercise, most people report feeling calmer, more relaxed and increased well-being. These effects are mentally and emotionally beneficial. However, the victim mentality can significantly interfere with getting regular exercise. Dr. Gilmartin notes:\\n\\n_\\"A sustained physical fitness program will not be found in the day-to-day life of an individual who views the world as a victim and who doesn't have proactive and disciplined time management.\\"_\\n\\nIn contrast, survivor officers do have disciplined time management and can allocate the time for fitness training as they recognize its importance. An optimal fitness routine involves 30-40 minutes of exercise, 4-5 days per week. Although this is a significant amount of time, a regular fitness routine returns physical and emotional benefits that far outweigh the time spent exercising.", "title": "Being a Survivor ", "summary": "Officers who develop a survivor mentality, rather than a victim mentality, recognize that they can and must be in charge of their personal time as much as possible.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-22 14:06:06.477768+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:37:33.955852+00	\N	f

When required to absorb work-related stressors quickly, or without time to emotionally decompress, officers can be faced with the distinct challenge of setting aside or compartmentalizing one stressful experience as they address other more urgent matters. If repeated again and again, this can reinforce a process of not addressing the emotional aspects of stressful events in a direct manner, while also increasing the cumulative demands placed upon an officer overtime. \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**\\"As much as we focus on the tangible safety measures that we want for our officers, you cannot negate the impact that this very stressful profession has on the overall well-being of our officers. Policing has increasingly become more complex, and our officers are not only constantly exposed to situations that are traumatic and demanding, but they are also often expected to move immediately from one stressful event to another.\\"** **\\\\- Terrence M. Cunningham, Chief of Police, Wellesley, Massachusetts, Police Department (from the May 2016 issue of Police Chief Magazine)** \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn addition to the dangers and stressors inherent in the nature of law enforcement work, officers must also navigate the challenges of increasing societal expectations, departmental politics, interpersonal relationships, financial stressors, and all of the other routine demands of life. On top of all of this, officers can be faced with traumatic events in the course of their work that, depending upon a variety of factors, carry the potential to magnify the stress response and disrupt coping, thus undermining wellness and lessening the ability to effectively manage future demands. \\n\\nFortunately, stress is a function of not only environmental demands, but also one's ability to deal with those demands, and there are many available tools, resources, and best practices to help promote emotional wellness and effectively manage stress. Perhaps the most important steps are acknowledging that officer emotional wellness must be prioritized, supporting programs for bolstering emotional wellness, and promoting a law enforcement culture that recognizes, encourages, and reinforces the utilization of such important resources. \\n\\nThe Cordico Online Wellness Resources provide you with access to modules for information, support, and guidance on topics including **Stress Management, Work-Life Balance, Emotional Health,** and **Resilience Development.** \\n\\nSimply click on the topic tabs to access any of the modules whenever you choose, according to your own needs, preferences, and interests.

This intensity may be a rewarding part of the job for some, giving a sense of purpose and excitement while on the job. However, once the shift is over, this can be followed by a physical and mental letdown, as though all the energy has been drained away. Some first responders feel numb and lethargic for hours after being energized during their shift. Unfortunately, this letdown typically happens soon after work, when you arrive at home. Instead of returning from feeling alert and energetic back to normal, you might drop right past normal, all the way to feeling tired, indifferent, and unresponsive. This may lead family to wonder why you aren't interacting with them. Children may wonder why mom or dad doesn't want to play. If this goes on for long, family relationships may become remote or conflicted.\\n\\nYou can protect your family and yourself from the effects of the after-work letdown by first recognizing and understanding that it is occurring. Keep in mind that your job may be creating stress and excitement, and that this heightened physical arousal will be followed by a significant drop in energy. This will help you to anticipate feeling tired and even numb after work. In addition, explaining this to your family can keep them from mistakenly assuming that you are not interested in the family. In addition, after anticipating the drop in energy, you can deliberately schedule a period of time to decompress, but also schedule specific times to interact fully with family. The reason that it is important to explicitly schedule times for these activities is that when your energy drops after hours on the job, your natural state will be to remain passive (common behavioral examples of this state include flipping through channels, going online with no real purpose, or playing video games). Without setting specific times to take care of yourself and tend to your relationships with others, you could easily spend much of your off-duty time engaged in mindless activities.\\n\\nSo as an important part of supporting your family, be sure to recognize if and when you are experiencing a pattern of major decrease in energy after getting off work. Be aware that this can cause you to tune out the people that you care about when you are at home, and then make a plan in advance to set times to pull yourself out of the low-energy fog, and engage with the people and activities that you value.", "title": "The After-Work Letdown", "summary": "The job of a first responder can involve intense emotions, and the fight-of-flight system may be running at top speed sometimes at work.

For example, because the digestion process is inhibited during the fight-or-flight response, the production of saliva (spit) decreases dramatically. Have you ever noticed that your mouth becomes very dry in high-stress situations? The fight-or-flight circuit has turned down saliva production in order to activate more important processes. This cotton mouth feeling can seem strange, and for some people it contributes to a sense that something is very wrong; this can make them feel even more threatened or stressed, and can become a distraction. Blood supply to the extremities (hands, feet, and face) is reduced, possibly to reduce blood loss if injured. This can result in one's face appearing pale, and having the hands and feet feel cold. The increased speed and force of the heart helps circulate blood to make energy more available to the muscles; but it can also feel like a jackhammer is pounding at your chest wall. Some people interpret this pounding as a signal that they are having a heart attack, and this can also become a distraction during high stress situations. The same goes for the increased breathing rate; some people start to feel short of breath, as though they can't quite catch their breath.

Work involves dangerous situations that require you to respond rapidly and decisively, putting yourself in harm’s way to protect others. In many of these situations, the fight-or-flight system is running at full speed. This part of our nervous system causes many changes – heart rate goes up, adrenaline is dumped into the bloodstream, and our minds are on high alert. For some first responders, this is one of the most rewarding parts of the job, providing a sense of excitement and purpose. They feel alert, alive, and energized while on the job.\\n\\nHowever, eventually there is a letdown, and some first responders describe feeling numb and apathetic for hours after being so alert while on the job. And when does this letdown typically happen? Right around the time you get home. Unfortunately, the letdown after work isn’t just a return to “normal” but is a drop from feeling alert and energetic, right past normal, all the way down to feeling apathetic, tired, and unresponsive. Family members may wonder why their loved one isn’t engaging with them; children may wonder why mom or dad doesn’t want to go out and play with them, or seems remote. As a result, family relationships may become strained and distant, and marital conflict may begin. Some first responders begin to feel hounded after arriving home, and start to avoid home by instead going to decompress somewhere else.\\n\\nIt is important for both the first responder and family members to recognize and understand what is occurring. First, recognize yourself that your job may be creating a high level of both excitement and stress, and that this state of heightened physical arousal will soon be followed by a major drop in energy. This way, you can anticipate that you are likely going to naturally feel somewhat tired and perhaps even numb as you leave work. Helping your family to recognize and understand this as well can help to ensure that they do not assume that you aren’t interested in them, or that you don’t care about them.\\n\\nSince you may often feel this way after work, it is important to take charge of maintaining your close relationships with family members and valued friends, while still respecting your own need to rest and recharge. One of the most important steps you can take is using effective time management skills to set aside time dedicated to being with friends and family, and other activities that you value.", "title": "Be Aware of the Roller Coaster", "summary": "Life as a first responder may be like a roller coaster.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-22 21:00:14.819899+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:20:03.85001+00	\N	f

While there is adequate scientific research that indicates fitness levels of law enforcement personnel correlate to a reduction in injury rates, medical costs and workers compensation claims, one could also make the argument that if we could assess risk for injury, this too would aid in cost savings for a department.

This means that they know the details of what is important in their partner's life: what foods they like, their favorite movies, their feelings toward different friends and neighbors, what makes them nervous, and what makes them feel special. \\n\\nA detailed love map is not created in a single day, but is the result of being attentive to the partner's emotional reactions, what they say about different people and situations, and noticing what events in their life history are especially significant to them. In other words, this involves noticing what one's partner cares about, and storing these details away, then drawing on this love map to anticipate and plan ways to enhance his or her happiness and satisfaction, and support him or her when difficult situations arise. \\n\\nItems from the _Love Maps Questionnaire_ included in the _Seven Principles_ book assess whether you know your partner's best friends; his or her favorite music, favorite movies, current stressors, major concerns, major aspirations, and most significant childhood events. If you find that you know most or all of these about your partner, then you likely have a solid love map of your partner. If not, it would be worth considering how you might begin to focus attention on your partner's emotional responses, concerns, and hopes, and intentionally storing these facts away. \\n\\nEven if you do have a strong love map of your partner, Dr. Gottman notes that this must be updated across time, as you and your partner grow and change. Dr. Gottman suggests asking each other a number of open-ended questions. For example, \\"How would you compare yourself as a mother (or father) to your own mother (or father)?\\"; \\"What is the most exciting thing happening in your life right now?\\"; \\"What is the one thing you would most like to change about your personality? Why?\\" Dr. Gottman recommends setting aside enough time to give these questions the respect and attention they deserve, as they involve very personal and potentially sensitive topics. Other themes to explore together might include difficulties you have faced; who you want to become; or your mission and legacy. As you continue to deepen and enrich your knowledge of your partner and his or her inner life, your relationship will become deeper, closer, and more satisfying.", "title": "Principle 1: Enhance Your \\"Love Maps\\"", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:27:25.130445+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:08.019537+00	\N	f

We use the term “panic attack” when the fight-or-flight response is activated in non-dangerous situations; in other words, a panic attack is a “false alarm” in the fight-or-flight system. Think of a car alarm: if someone tries to break into a car when the alarm is set, the sensors in the alarm will detect the motion caused by the thief’s attempts, triggering the alarm mechanism. The alarm will sound, lights will flash, and the thief will be warned off. But the same car alarm may be triggered simply by other vehicles driving by, causing the car to rock slightly. Even though there is no attempted break-in, this movement sets off a “false alarm.” The sounds and flashing lights are just as intense for the false alarm as when someone is actually trying to break in; once the alarm circuitry is tripped, it responds with full strength.\\n\\nThe process is similar with the fight-or-flight response and panic attacks. Many people, especially during periods of stress, will have the input to their threat detection system reach a critical threshold so that the fight-or-flight “switch” gets thrown. At this point, it is very much like a car alarm going off – all of the intensity of a full-blown response to a threat are set off, so that one’s heart pounds rapidly, the mouth goes dry, breathing gets rapid, and a feeling of impending doom and a need to escape may seem overwhelming. Panic attacks are not dangerous by themselves; they don’t cause any physical harm, and don’t mean that anything is medically or psychologically wrong. However, sometimes people become distracted by the sensations of a panic attack, because they misinterpret them as a sign that they are having a heart attack, or “losing their mind.” It is helpful to remember that having your heart race or pound in your chest will not harm you, nor will feeling short of breath, or sweating. Quite the opposite – these sensations are an indication that your body is fully charged and ready to take on challenges. Remember that a racing heart, sweating, and shortness of breath are what elite professional football and basketball players experience much of the time when they are at work, and they perform incredible physical feats while feeling that way.\\n\\nAt the same time, athletes can perform superbly with a racing heart and shortness of breath because they are used to feeling that way – they are so familiar with the sensations that they are not distracted by them. As a correctional officer or correctional staff, it is important that you be aware of the physical sensations of anxiety, including panic attacks, so that you do not become distracted by these sensations during high-stress situations. This article includes descriptions of what happens biologically during anxiety and panic, the reasons for anxiety and panic responses, and common sensations, emotions, and thoughts that often go along with anxiety and panic. While reviewing this material, it would be helpful if you would try to focus on the described sensations, and even see if you can reproduce some of the sensations. You could also recall a time when you felt highly anxious or panicked, and just observe those sensations, thoughts, and emotions in your mind. The more that you can become a neutral observer of these sensations, and the more familiar you can become with them as a neutral observer, the less distracted you will be by these sensations in high-stress situations. For example, you may feel your heart pounding in your chest and just remind yourself, “Yep, there’s the fight-or-flight response, hard at work.” By understanding and being familiar with the sensations of the fight-or-flight response, your ability to focus on the situation at hand, and to quickly make appropriate decisions, will likely be enhanced.", "title": "Panic Attacks as “False Alarms”", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 14:14:31.184512+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 14:14:31.184512+00	\N	f

Recall the dry mouth, shaking hands, rapid breathing, or racing heart. Simply notice these sensations in your memory, and picture yourself having these sensations in a future situation. Picture yourself letting these sensations occur while you effectively carry out the actions you need to do. This practice allows you to combine your rehearsal of your first responder duties with your accepting observation of the physical feelings of the stress response. The more familiar and accepting you become of these sensations, the less distracted you will be by them in a high-stress situation.\\n\\nFinally, taking some time to practice a relaxation exercise, either through guided muscle relaxation, or some form of mindful meditation, can help to reduce some of the physical and psychological effects that repeated stress can cause. Taking as little as 10 minutes each day to address the business of managing your stress can help to keep you focused, healthier, and more effective.", "title": "Coping Effectively with the Stress Response", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 20:00:57.598628+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:10:46.295648+00	\N	f

And most people without substance use problems have the same belief – people should be able to stop using if they set their mind to it. And certainly, some people do successfully stop using on their own without any additional help. However, using elevated levels of alcohol or other substances for weeks or months causes changes in the brain that persist long after the person stops using. A result of changes in brain functioning includes cravings and strong urges to use the drug, and these can interfere with the ability to think clearly or exercise control over one’s behavior. As a result, people with the best of intentions may be able to keep from using on some occasions, but find that they are unable to reliably and consistently stop themselves from using the substance over longer periods of time.\\n\\nFor example, some may successfully stop drinking for a month, during which they spend time with family, or go to the gym or other activities instead of drinking with friends or at home. But after a month, an old drinking buddy may stop by with beer, or the person may have had a major stressor at work, followed by an ugly fight with their spouse; these situations can serve as powerful triggers to reach for a drink, followed by another drink, and so on. Cues such as these can bring on intense craving, which may feel too strong to resist. It can be very difficult to think clearly in the moment and develop successful ways to keep from relapsing. Part of successful treatment involves anticipating these triggers to use alcohol or other substances, and planning ways to successfully cope with them.", "title": "Why Don't People Just Stop Using on Their Own?", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 19:47:10.057157+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:12:35.57237+00	\N	f

Next, check in with your family members to see if they have noticed your difficult emotions, and how they may have been affected. For example, if you have been irritable, they may have thought that they had done something wrong; while if you have been disengaged, they may have thought that you no longer enjoy being with them. It can be helpful to clarify with them that you have been having some difficult emotions because of events at work and reinforce to them the strength of your love and commitment to them.

The first responder job encourages a one-income household.\\n\\n1.  **Unpredictable hours**  \\n    Working as a police wife or fire wife is a huge challenge because a police officer and firefighter's schedule is so unpredictable. Yeah, sure, their shift says that they get off at a certain time but we learn very quickly what that really means. As a police wife, you might hear \\"I'll be late, I'm not sure when I'm coming home.\\" Maybe there's been a critical incident and you get \\"I'm not sure when they will even let us leave.\\" As a fire wife, you're counting on them returning home after two days gone to share the household responsibilities and you get a call: \\"I've been forced back.\\" Or maybe the call, \\"We were sent out on a strike team in the middle of the night and we're halfway to L.A., I'm not sure when I'll be back,\\" knowing it could be up to two weeks. I've been there! \\n2.  **Responsibilities with children**  \\n    I make the joke that prior to children my first response to a strike team call out was \\"Do you have snacks? Do you have clothes? Call me as soon as you can!\\" With a child now, my response is closer to a pause and a long \\"Okaaaaay\\"... and my thoughts are racing thinking now everything he was responsible for is my problem. What's running through my head is that I have two hours before work to figure out what I need to cancel, rearrange, and/or get someone else to cover in our next two weeks. Sometimes extended family can fill in these gaps, which we are very grateful to be able to utilize. \\n3.  **Good income**  \\n    Not to mention that overtime is oftentimes mandatory or easily accessible to make up for unexpected expenses. Like so many other first responder families you think it's just easier if I stay home and you just work O.T. to fill in the gaps. You share this decision with so many other families in a similar situation. \\n\\nHaving the option to stay home with your children is awesome! Making this decision out of pure excitement is one thing. Making it \\"because it just makes sense\\" is another. If you have your own passions and visions of a job or a hobby, maybe a specific degree in something you enjoy or have the thing you keep putting off for \\"one day\\", then listen up. I'm going to ask you to rethink the decision for the following reasons.\\n\\n1.  **Not as helpful as we think**  \\n    In these scenarios, I think staying home full time and putting your dreams on hold has the potential to actually take away from your family (hear me out). What I mean is that we're happier people when we feel fulfilled. Not that staying home with our children isn't fulfilling, but if you personally have a dream of a life balanced out with something else, then finding that will absolutely benefit your children and your marriage. \\n2.  **Your happiness is worth more**  \\n    Please, don't get stuck on, \\"I make as much as daycare would cost so it wouldn't even be worth it.\\" Of course, it would be worth it! Even if you make exactly what daycare costs! I'm not looking at just numbers here. That's silly because we're human beings with real emotions and stress. Having something that feeds us emotionally is worth more than a number. \\n3.  **How it may positively impact the rest of your life**  \\n    We're happier! This means we combat stress and depression and we're likely to have stronger relationships. We model positive coping skills for our children and have more tolerance for the stress parenting brings on. We feel less resentful in our marriage and toward the job first responders love so much and spend so much time at. This all has an extremely positive domino effect on our lives. So, don't wait! \\n\\nWhat I am suggesting is that if there is a job or a hobby you desire please go out and find it! The same applies even if it's not a passion exactly but you're feeling like you could just use a little more balance in your life. Guilt-free! Because ultimately, it's going to benefit your family and [your own wellness](https://www.firstresponderfamilypsychology.com/first-responder-spouse).  \\n\\nWritten by Dr. Rachelle Zemlock originally published [here](https://www.firstresponderfamilypsychology.com/post/finding-balance-as-a-first-responder-spouse).", "title": "Finding Balance as A First Responder Spouse", "summary": "Let's be honest.

Physical fitness tests, full psychological testing, and interviews from psychologists, academies push them to extremes mentally and physically, background checks calling individuals from their past to hear about prior relationships and mistakes they may have made. Intense to say the least. They pass all those tests, make the commitment to serve and protect our community, and then they can be very ill-prepared for [the impacts the nature of their work may have on their health, wellness, and relationships](https://www.firstresponderfamilypsychology.com/first-responder-support). \\n\\nBy now many of us, fire and police wives have seen first-hand or have heard about some of the very serious negative impacts a career can have on a first responder and their relationships. First responders in general have higher rates of PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation than the general population. They develop higher rates of cardiac issues, sleep disorders, and cancer for firefighters. Their personalities can slowly shift into a more safety-conscious, negative, distrustful, or isolating version of themselves. They might lack the tools to deal effectively with such challenges which can lead to an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, struggling relationships with family members, and a sedentary lifestyle. It can be really hard to prepare first responders for the potential negative impacts because this can be a gradual often unnoticeable decline. Whether or not you are seeing signs of any of this or you’re just interested in preventing them from occurring, here are five tips for a first responder spouse to try and help their first responder beat the impacts.\\n\\n1.  **Be Proactive When It Comes to Personal Life**  \\n    Plan things – even when they might get ruined! The job and the schedule take over our personal lives and they will continue to do so if we let it. If we wait for the right time, when life is less crazy, or when they feel up for it, things may NEVER happen. Then suddenly we’re bored with life and one another. **New and fun experiences together help boost our mood and relationships.** Maybe it’s a family trip or just a date night out. Put it in the calendar early! **Schedule things, many things, and plan on them.** Advice: discuss and make plans maybe on a day off when there is little stress and you’re both in a good mood. After work, or in the middle of the workweek, I expect their fatigue, adrenaline dumps from the job, and the potentially horrible things they saw at work to get in the way of any potential excitement or energy. Maybe they don’t jump for joy to head out the door to try that new restaurant you agreed on last month. Try not to take that personally if possible. That doesn’t mean they do not love you or want to spend time with you. Do it anyway! Hopefully, things make a shift once you arrive.\\n2.  **Help Them Make Time for Non Work-Related Activities**  \\n    Our daily experiences shape our outlook on the world. Which of course means the daily experiences that first responders encounter on shift will have a pretty big impact on their outlook on the world. They can commonly develop a more cautious, negative, and distrustful approach to the world. Of course, what they encounter is all real life, the problem is the imbalance of how many bad things they see in relation to how often those things occur on average for the general population. It can be a pretty dark skewed version of the world. The best way to try and counterbalance that is to try and limit more negativity and to connect them to people and activities that bring out more positivity. This can get harder and harder as the years go on. Now of course having support from other first responders that “get it” is great too. But try and **encourage the continued connection to those people and hobbies they once loved prior to becoming a first responder or new ones** they are interested in as a way for them to escape some of what comes along with the job. \\n3.  **Support Healthy Habits**  \\n    We know a lot of health-related issues result from stress. First responders endure significant amounts of stress related to their work. There is the departmental stress, likely the stuff you hear most complaints about. In addition, they physically put their body through interesting highs and lows. Our bodies aren’t necessarily meant to be calm (having a conversation and eating lunch) then suddenly thrown into emergency situations where our life or someone else's might be at risk, then back to calm, and so on. Yet they do this every shift for years. You can see why it can take such a toll on their body. We know that there are ways we can help our bodies cope with the stress though! That’s healthy habits. They need it more than the average individual to fight all the significant impacts. You can help **make family time active,** or **make time in their day to hit the gym** and de-stress. Maybe meal prepping to plan more healthy lunches and dinners would be helpful. \\n4.  **Encourage More Sleep**  \\n    Fatigue has such a great impact on first responders and their family members. [They often work many more hours than the average individual.](https://www.firstresponderfamilypsychology.com/post/the-impacts-of-too-much-overtime) As discussed earlier, their job places physical and mental stress on them in ways that can increase fatigue. Many of them work odd hours or respond to calls in the middle of the night. On top of that, there can be times when they are held over beyond what you might imagine, there are callouts and forced O.T. that interrupt the days they should be catching up on sleep. It’s really easy to acquire sleep debt as a first responder. We know sleep impacts so many aspects of our life and health long term. Daily it can look like irritability, short-tempered, lack of energy, disengaged, nodding off. When possible **encourage them to catch up on sleep with naps or full nights versus using caffeine to keep them going.** \\n5.  **Be Aware of How Much Is Too Much**  \\n    If we know that [time on at work can have short and long term impacts on a first responder’s health and wellness](https://www.firstresponderfamilypsychology.com/post/the-impacts-of-too-much-overtime), it’s important to pay attention to how much time they are putting in and how much is too much. Do they still have a balanced life outside of work? Are the two of you still able to find time for one another? Have a discussion about why they are working so much? Is it temporary? Yes, certain points in the career can require more of them such as training/ probation or new assignments. Is it the family’s financial situation? Are there changes the family can make to cut down on bills in order to require less of them at work or does it make sense for two incomes as a way to allow them more balance? Basically, I am recommending you **constantly assess and discuss how much time is actually being spent at work and weigh it against the costs and come to a compromise that everyone is comfortable with.** \\n\\nObviously, easier said than done… but so important to try and help our first responders beat the impacts of this career. They deserve it and [you do too](https://www.firstresponderfamilypsychology.com/post/finding-balance-as-a-first-responder-spouse)!

These principles apply across legal substances, including alcohol, nicotine, and prescription medications, as well as illicit substances. The development of substance dependence involves several brain circuits, particularly those related to the experience of pleasure and reward, as well as circuits involved in memory. Because of this, some researchers consider addiction to be a \\"brain disease\\". Genetic makeup appears to play an important role in making some people more vulnerable to developing substance dependence problems than others. However, it is clear that environmental influences such as the frequency of being exposed to substances and the age of first use of the substance. The changes caused by using the substance over time begins to modify brain functioning in ways that reduce the person's ability to stop using, so that seeking out and using the substance is experience as compulsive, despite the person's efforts to discontinue substance use. Researchers and clinicians have long recognized that \\"willpower\\" alone is not sufficient to allow someone to stop using a substance after they have begun a pattern of problem substance use.\\n\\nBecoming free of the harmful effects of substance abuse requires more than a simple one-time decision to stop. For some people, making a commitment to stop using the substance is accompanied by significant changes in their daily habits, such as meeting with friends or neighbors who do not use the substance, or going to the gym or an AA meeting instead of getting drinks. They may also seek support from others, either informally from friends or family members, or by attending AA meetings (or Narcotics Anonymous or Cocaine Anonymous). When significant changes are made that allow the person to successfully remain abstinent or in control of the problem substance, then formal treatment may not be needed.\\n\\nHowever, research indicates that someone with a significant alcohol or substance use problem would probably be more successful with recovery by enrolling into a professional treatment program.  The following section describes the main approaches to treatment for substance use problems.", "title": "Treatment for Problems with Alcohol and Other Substances", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 19:49:27.37976+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:12:39.889596+00	\N	f

For example, describing an event by saying, \\"I completely froze, and people died because I was a coward,\\" involves conclusions and value judgments that are not at all objective. An objective description of the event might be, \\"I saw the (emergency situation) and started trying to make sense of what was happening. For several seconds I was unsure what action to take, and in that time period, the (emergency situation) worsened and people died before I was able to act. I later recognized what I could have done, but by that time it was too late.\\" This second description is more objective, and takes into account the realities of being human and impossibility of knowing in every moment the best action to take. \\n\\nDescribing the event objectively and neutrally offers some emotional distance. There is a benefit to reviewing the event in terms of the different factors that led to the event occurring, and trying to understand the actions of people involved. This processing of the event should also take into account the previous experiences of the people involved. Consider a correctional officer who previously held his fire when confronting a suspect in a darkened environment. The suspect then fired, striking the correctional officer's partner. This officer's history now includes the very significant and painful memory of having his officer shot when the officer decided not to fire on a suspect. In the future, if this officer experienced the morally injurious event of firing on an unarmed suspect, this previous history of harmful consequences from not firing would be important in healing from this event, because it helps to explain the correctional officer's later decision to fire more readily. \\n\\nSimilarly, some military personnel have reported becoming excessively forceful and, in some cases, continuing to shoot at surrendering enemy combatants. If no other information was available, one might conclude that they were sadistic or intentionally cruel. However, some soldiers have had the experience of becoming hyper-aggressive after \\"freezing\\" in their initial contacts with the enemy. One soldier froze in his first firefight, and witnessed his buddy being fatally shot by the enemy while he was unable to react with protective fire. The soldier felt intense shame for what he perceived as his own cowardice, and attempted to compensate for it by making sure to open fire any time he thought he detected an enemy. As a result, he ended up shooting at not only active enemy fighters, but also at surrendering or wounded enemies, as well as unarmed civilians. As you can see, his effort to make up for his earlier inaction caused him to engage in acts that violated moral standards; however, the soldier did not intend to behave immorally. The reason this is important is that we can sometimes make sense of actions when we get a fuller and more detailed picture of all of the factors that led up to a moral injury event.", "title": "Processing Moral Injury ", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 15:51:03.9971+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 15:51:03.9971+00	\N	f

Suicide has lasting effects on friends, family, and other survivors. In the generally close-knit environment of most law enforcement agencies, its' impact is often deeply felt by colleagues and can have significant emotional impact and consequences on the behavior and attitudes of departmental personnel. In part, this is due to the stigma that often is attached to suicide, particularly in a line of work such as policing. Law enforcement personnel are trained and expected to be problem solvers and maintain self-control under the most difficult situations. They are often reluctant to admit weaknesses or vulnerabilities. They may hesitate to seek assistance or support from professionals, family members, or friends for personal issues that they fear could jeopardize their career. Police departments and other agencies often contribute to the stigma of suicide by limiting ceremonial recognitions so valuable to survivors, disallowing survivors’ financial benefits, or failing to ensure that survivors of suicides receive the same formal and informal support provided to families in other active or inactive duty deaths. \\n\\n**Nature and Scope of the Problem**\\n\\nOver 33,000 persons in the U.S. completed suicide in 2006 or about one person every 16 minutes. An estimated 811,000 persons attempted to complete suicide in that same year. The exact number and rate of police officer suicide is not available since there is no central repository for data collection. Furthermore, most believe that it is commonly underreported due to stigma and concerns over the individual’s and department’s reputation. Research to date, however, indicates that the rate probably ranges between 17 and 22 police suicides per 100,000, and between 119 and 154 officers per year, similar to military personnel. This also means law enforcement officers are twice as likely to kill themselves as to be killed by someone else and three times more likely to die from suicide than from accidental death. Yet, officers are trained that the most serious danger they face is from the hand of suspects. Profiles are limited in accuracy and value since suicide cuts across age, sex, race, and other lines. However, statistics alone tell us that the most “typical” victim of police suicide is a married, middle-aged white male who is often tenured. Of these, about 86 percent completed suicide while off duty, 91 percent with a handgun, and about 55 percent while at home.2 As troubling as these statistics may be, there is some comfort and hope in the fact that most experts believe that the majority of suicides are preventable. A major component of prevention lies in having appropriate resources in place and educating officers about their availability. These resources must be highly visible, easily accessible, and offered without recrimination or consequence. A final key is the ability and willingness of fellow officers, family members, and police agencies to identify officers in need of assistance and to provide or facilitate the provision of appropriate services to affected employees quickly and without unnecessary repercussions. \\n\\n**Facts and Myths on Suicide**\\n*   Myth: People who talk about suicide don’t commit suicide.\\n*   Fact: Of any ten persons who kill themselves, eight have  \\n    given a definite warning of their suicidal intentions.\\n*   Myth: Suicide happens without warning.\\n*   Fact: Studies reveal that the suicidal person gives many  \\n    clues and warnings regarding his suicidal intentions.\\n*   Myth: Suicidal people are fully intent on dying.  \\n    \\n*   Fact: Most suicidal people are undecided about living or dying, and they “gamble with death,” leaving it to others to save them. Very few suicidal people die by suicide without letting others know how he or she is feeling.\\n*   Myth: Once a person is suicidal, he is suicidal forever.\\n*   Fact: Individuals who wish to kill themselves are “suicidal” only for a limited period of time.  \\n    \\n*   Myth: Improvement following a suicidal crisis means that  \\n    the suicidal risk is over.\\n*   Fact: Most suicides occur within about three months following the beginning of “improvement” when the individual has the energy to put his morbid thoughts and feelings into effect.\\n*   Myth: Suicide strikes much more often among the rich.\\n*   Fact: Suicide is neither the rich man’s disease nor the poor man’s curse. Suicide is very “democratic” and is represented proportionately among all levels of society.\\n*   Myth: All suicidal individuals are mentally ill, and suicide always is the act of a psychotic person.\\n*   Fact: Studies of hundreds of genuine suicide notes indicate that although the suicidal person is extremely unhappy, he may not be mentally ill.\\n\\n**Warning Signs**\\n\\nWhile there are always exceptions, the vast majority of people who attempt or complete suicide communicate their  \\nintent in some fashion. Officers, as well as supervisors, should be aware of and willing to respond to the following warning signs.\\n\\n**Risk-taking.**\\n\\nOfficers who have ceased to care about themselves may take unnecessary risks on the job.\\n\\n**Increase in use of force incidents.** \\n\\nOfficers under pressure may become overly aggressive and take out their anger on arrestees or others confronted during the course of duty.\\n\\n**Rise in vehicle collisions.**\\n\\nOfficers may begin to drive in a reckless manner as part of risk-taking and aggression.\\n\\n**Substance abuse.**\\n\\nStressed officers may increase their intake of alcohol or engage in substance abuse in order to “numb” their pain.\\n\\n**Putting things in order.**\\n\\nOfficers who suddenly give away valued possessions are sending a red flag. Officers may also ask questions about or settle their beneficiary information, their financial affairs, or any spiritual needs.\\n\\n**Losing interest in work.**\\n\\nMost people go through periods of reduced performance but sudden changes in performance that continue for unreasonable periods should be monitored. \\n\\n**Talking about death or suicide.**\\n\\nVerbal cues such as “I can’t go on any longer,” “Nobody needs me anymore,” “I’m tired of life,” or “You won’t be seeing me anymore,” should not be overlooked.\\n\\n**Withdrawing from family and friends.**\\n\\nAn otherwise sociable person who suddenly retreats from social interaction.  \\n\\nThere is rarely a single causal event but rather a multitude of factors that lead to suicide. It is critical that suicidal behavior be viewed on a continuum of severity ranging from suicidal thoughts to completed suicidal acts. Research suggests there is often a similar constellation of factors present in most suicides. This “deadly triad” includes depressive mood, alcohol abuse, and the break-up of an intimate relationship. Humiliation, embarrassment, and feelings of loss of control are frequently also associated with these as well as other stressful life issues. Improving awareness of factors that increase the risk for suicide is critical in developing effective suicide prevention interventions. The following factors have been identified as key risk factors for an individual contemplating suicide:\\n\\n**History of Previous Attempts.**\\n\\nBetween 50 and 80 percent of those who ultimately complete suicide have a history of at least one prior attempt.\\n\\n**Lethality of Prior Attempts.**\\n\\nThe more lethal a prior attempt, the greater the risk for a subsequent attempt. Gunshot wounds, jumping from high places, and hanging are usually associated with quick deaths and therefore represent more lethal attempts. Wrist cutting and minor drug ingestion are considered less lethal. Also, the more violent and painful the attempt, the greater the risk of future attempts. Over 57 percent of male and 31 percent of female suicides are carried out with firearms. Poisoning by gases, solids, or liquids account for 23 percent of the total. Among men, poisoning represents less than one-eighth of total completed suicides.\\n\\n**Workable Plan.** \\n\\nThe danger of a lethal suicide plan is heightened if the individual has access to and familiarity with lethal means to attempt suicide (e.g., firearms).\\n\\n**Depressed Mood.** \\n\\nSuicide risk increases with depressed mood, especially if signs such as loss of appetite and weight, decreased libido, sleep difficulties, and early morning awakening are present. Individuals should be aware that suicide risk may increase early during treatment with anti-depressants as the return of energy brings about an increased ability to carry out self-destructive plans.\\n\\n**Lack of Future Plans.** \\n\\nA lack of plans for the future or a preoccupation with plans related to the aftermath of death increases risk. A high-risk individual may talk about how he or she will be viewed at the funeral or what friends and relatives will do after he or she is gone.  \\n\\n**Alcohol and Drug Abuse.** \\n\\nSuicide risk is difficult to predict in alcoholics, and many single-occupant motor vehicle accidents on the highway may represent suicides. Alcohol and/or various drugs may trigger self and other-directed violent impulses. Medications such as pain relievers, valium, or antidepressants plus alcohol represent a particularly lethal combination.\\n\\n**Recent Loss.** \\n\\nRisk is increased if a person recently experienced the loss of a loved one through death, separation, or divorce.\\n\\n**Physical Illness.** \\n\\nThere is an increase in risk if an individual has a debilitating physical illness or condition that results in chronic pain (e.g., cancer, heart attack, or traumatic injury with loss of function).  \\n\\n**Marital Status.** \\n\\nThe suicide rate for single individuals is approximately twice that of married persons. Divorced and widowed individuals have rates that are four to five times that of married persons. In the widowed population, risks are greatest during the first year after the death of a spouse. Rates are lowest among married persons, especially if they have children.\\n\\n**Gender.** \\n\\nMore women attempt suicide, but more men complete the act. Studies indicate that women attempt suicide three times as often as men, but that men complete suicide four times as often as women. This may in part be due to the fact that men typically use more lethal means such as firearms while women tend to overdose, permitting more time for discovery or reconsideration prior to the attempt becoming lethal.\\n\\n**Sexual Orientation.** \\n\\nIndividuals with a predominately homosexual orientation have a higher risk, especially if they are depressed, aging, without a partner, or when alcohol and/or drugs are involved.\\n\\n**Family History.** \\n\\nRisk is increased if there is a family history of suicide, especially in a same-sex parent. Some studies have shown that up to 25 percent of individuals attempting suicide had a history of suicide in the immediate family.\\n\\n**Prevention: Management**\\n\\nAn overarching issue for the prevention of suicide in law enforcement agencies is the existence of policies, protocols, and customary practices that inhibit employees from seeking help and may undercut the effectiveness of suicide prevention messages given by management. A related problem is that police officers and civilian co-workers may deny the existence of emotional problems and depression because of the culture of policing. Concerns about being labeled unreliable and unstable can be difficult to overcome when an individual is already feeling hopeless and alienated from friends and coworkers. An individual’s fear may range from losing promotional opportunities to being relieved of duty and losing police powers.\\n\\nThe use of mental health professionals remains stigmatized by many segments of society, particularly among the police, firefighters, and other professions that hold courage, bravery, and strength in the highest esteem. \\n\\nIf seeking help is regarded as a weakness and symptomatic of a person fundamentally ill-equipped for the job, officers will invariably deny that they have a problem and avoid seeking help. In addition, out of a sense of loyalty, fellow police officers and supervisors may overlook, deny, or diminish the problem. While done with good intentions, these actions serve to delay or circumvent depressed or suicidal officers from getting the help they may desperately need. \\n\\nThese basic fears, and any departmental policies and practices that support them, must be changed in order to ensure the success of suicide intervention programming. Prevention and intervention programs will only work if officers can take advantage of them without concern for their career or reputation. Through departmental policy, practice, and training, management must assure officers and other employees that seeking mental health assistance will not, in and of itself, result in job termination or adverse consequences; that all personal medical information will be respected and remain confidential as provided by law; that someone will be available to assist them with a problem on a confidential basis and that there is always an alternative to suicide or other self-destructive behaviors no matter how hopeless the situation may seem. \\n\\nSuicide prevention should be regarded as a problem-solving activity designed to assist a troubled officer in need and to facilitate his or her return to a fully functioning level, both personally and professionally. It is essential to de-stigmatize asking for help, particularly regarding issues related to feelings of depression and suicide. An effective method to reach both sworn and civilian in every rank and classification could be through in-service training. Careful consideration should be given to providing this training to officers’ spouses or significant others who are often in the best position to identify emerging problems. \\n\\n**Intervention: Fellow Officers and Supervisors**\\n\\nOfficers who work closely with one another are in ideal positions to recognize signs of stress, depression, and suicidal risk factors in fellow employees. No one sign or behavior can be regarded as an indicator that an officer is suicidal. However, all signs should be taken seriously, and the more signs and symptoms present, the greater the concern and vigilance. \\n\\nPersons who are contemplating suicide are generally ambivalent. They see suicide as a release from the pain they feel. Their mental state inhibits them from thinking clearly, gaining perspective on their problems, or identifying alternatives. Up to 85 percent of all persons who completed suicides exhibited behaviors such as displaying signs and symptoms noted earlier in this document in the few weeks or months prior to their deaths to indicate to others that they were in deep despair and in need of help. The typically short span of time between the display of such signs and a suicide attempt makes it imperative that intervention be conducted quickly. \\n\\nInitial inquiries should not be postponed for fear of embarrassing or offending the individual involved. Preventing suicide is far more important than the need to protect feelings, self-image, or friendships. Peers also need assistance understanding that helping a fellow officer is not “getting him or her in trouble.” Early intervention saves lives and careers. \\n\\nOfficers are particularly hesitant to reveal to others that they are contemplating suicide or even that they “have a problem.” Early identification of an at-risk officer is therefore particularly important. Police officers have good instincts about people and, in this, as in other cases, officers should trust their instincts about their colleagues. When a fellow officer displays uncommon behaviors that reflect depression and the possibility of suicide, he or she should be contacted as soon as reasonably possible. If you do not feel close enough to the individual to engage in the conversation, another person who is closer to the officer may be contacted to discuss the situation and potentially intervene. If available, trained peer support personnel within the department can be a good source of intervention. \\n\\nWhen approaching a potentially suicidal officer, co-workers, supervisors or others need to be prepared to employ their professional listening skills and allow enough time for the involved officer to ventilate his or her feelings and engage in discussion. Formal training is not necessary in order to facilitate a meaningful conversation. Police officers are good communicators and particularly insightful. Simple empathy and understanding, combined with encouragement to talk and express emotions, is often sufficient to gain an understanding of the seriousness or depth of the problem and determine whether additional measures are appropriate or professional help should be sought. A location should be chosen where a private conversation can take place and sufficient time should be spent talking with and listening to the officer. \\n\\nDuring these conversations, officers should reassure the affected officer that it is natural to have the feelings and emotions that he or she is experiencing. Simple comments such as, “I can understand that…” or, “I can image I would feel the same way” facilitate ventilation of emotions without being judgmental or overly solicitous. The inquiring officer should avoid using euphemisms to express what he or she wants to say. \\n\\nBe direct when talking with a potentially suicidal individual. The individual should be asked what has happened in the immediate past to create his or her depression. If the depression appears to be severe and the individual is potentially suicidal, ask him or her directly, “Have you been thinking of hurting or killing yourself?” You must not let any trepidation you have stop you from asking the question directly. Simply asking will not plant the seed of suicide in an otherwise nonsuicidal individual. In another direct approach, ask the person: “You know, when people are as upset as you seem to be, they sometimes wish they were dead. I’m wondering if you feel that way?” If the individual’s intentions are not totally clear, talk to the individual about the value of his or her life, the finality of death, and alternative means of solving his or her problems. This could include the use of departmental staff or a consulting psychologist, an independent therapist, personal clergy or a police chaplain, or discussion with family members. Attempt to determine the officer’s attitude about these or other alternatives and whether he or she is willing to pursue one or more of them in the near term. If there is hesitancy, propose setting up the appointment and going with the officer to the appointment as a further show of support and concern and to ensure that follow-up actually takes place. \\n\\nLet the officer know that you and others are on his or her side and that together you can find a solution. It should be remembered that the closer someone is to attempting suicide, the more resistant he or she may be to accepting help. Therefore, a colleague must be persistent when he or she senses that the affected officer is erecting artificial roadblocks to helpful suggestions. In some cases, however, persons contemplating suicide feel that they cannot be helped, that there is no hope, and no alternatives. Here again, persistence on the part of the intervening officer is important, along with persuasion. For example, gentle persuasion may include the use of such statements as: “Will you go with me to get help?” or “Will you let me help you get help?” Also, emphasize the value of the officer and his or her importance to family, friends, and co-workers should anything happen to them. People in deep depressions often become so self-absorbed in their problems that they forget the ramifications and harm that would be created by self-destructive behavior. In most instances, active listening, honest discussion, and a show of caring and empathy, coupled with a discussion of positive actions can move a person away from thoughts of harming themselves. The next best option to taking someone to a care provider is gaining a commitment from them that they will accept help if arrangements are made for that help. Finally, the least favorable but sometimes the only alternative is to provide referral information and attempt to get a good faith commitment that it will be used. If it becomes reasonably clear during the course of conversation that the individual is thinking of suicide, determine if he or she has thought the action through and has a plan for carrying out the act. If the individual expresses a desire to die or complete the act of suicide, professional help must be sought immediately. An officer must never abide by a request or even a promise to keep the discussion of suicide a secret. The individual should not be left alone if at all possible and immediate contact should be made with an appropriate departmental authority who can take action to pursue voluntary crisis hospitalization or direct referral to a psychologist for such purposes. A psychologist can more quickly facilitate a hospitalization and serve in the post-discharge follow-up process. A supervisor can also remove the officer from duty and remove all of his or her weapons to reduce risk and take the officer directly to a physician or therapist. This is important considering that the vast majority of police suicides are committed with the officer’s service handgun or other weapons. \\n\\n**Some final “dos” and “don’ts” of intervention include the following.** \\n\\nDo not overlook signs, sound shocked, offer empty promises or platitudes, debate morality, leave the person alone, or remain the only person helping. \\n\\nRemain calm, help define the problem, rephrase thoughts, focus on central issues, stay close, emphasize the temporary nature of the problem, listen intently, and take action to prevent the person from killing themselves.", "title": "IACP: Officer Suicide Prevention ", "summary": "Although suicide among police officers may not meet the classic definition of an epidemic, the prevalence of suicide among police officers is too high.

They both earned the same salaries. But their financial situations followed very different paths. After working in lower-wage jobs before entering law enforcement, Officer Gary was excited to start making a bigger salary. He took advantage of the credit card offers that came his way, bought a nice car (with no money down!), and soon put a down payment on a house with a mortgage that was at the very limit of what he qualified for.\\n\\nWithin the first year, Gary's credit cards were near their maximum limits. He couldn't pay them down, because his car payments and mortgage took most of his salary, so he paid 14% interest on the balance carried on his credit cards. He couldn't draw from savings to pay the credit cards down, because he had no savings - all of his salary went to make payments on the debt he had acquired. As the years went by, Gary significantly cut back on his spending - by necessity, since his credit cards were maxed out. Eventually, his car broke down, and the air conditioner in his house needed to be replaced. Financial pressures became a steady source of stress for Gary. He realized that by carrying balances of $10,000 total on his credit cards, and paying only the minimum required amount, he was paying more than $1,400 per year in interest charges alone. At this rate, even though he paid $200 or more each month, he still owed nearly $9,000 at the end of the year. He realized that if he continued living this way, it would take more than six years to pay off his credit cards, even if he made no additional purchases with the credit cards. And he would end up paying more than $5,000 in interest - fully half of what he had spent on the credit cards in the first place. With no savings, maxed out credit cards, and no money left over after paying his bills, Gary realized that he needed to make a significant change.\\n\\nOfficer Mike was having much better financial success. Officer Mike carried no credit card balance. Instead, he kept track of how much money he had in savings, how much income was available each month, and saved up for large purchases. He made sure to build up enough money in his savings account that if an unexpected expense arose, he would be able to cover it. He saved up for a down payment on a home that was well within his means so that he could pay the mortgage note without fear of running out of money each month. Although he received many credit card offers and could have filled his house with expensive new furniture and a large home theater system, he only purchased furnishings that he could afford without draining his savings too much. He bought a few more items each month as his income permitted, staying within his monthly budget each time. Because he planned well and spent less than he made, every month he was able to add to his investment account, which was growing increasingly larger. Down the road, this investment account would give him the freedom to pay for things that were important to him, like taking trips, buying a nicer car, putting your children through college, or retiring early.\\n\\nHow did Officer Mike end up so much better off than Officer Gary? Mike followed several simple but powerful guidelines to make sure that he was financially fit.

Mike followed several simple but powerful rules to make sure that he was financially fit. The most important are these three core rules to financial fitness:\\n\\n1.  **Live within your means.**\\n2.  **Make a budget and stick to it.**\\n3.  **Pay your credit card off completely every month.**\\n\\nIf you follow these rules and no others, you will be well on your way to excellent financial fitness. If you ignore these three rules, it will be significantly more difficult to achieve financial fitness. Before moving on to the additional rules, take a minute or two to review these three rules, and think about how well you are following them. If you are following all three, great! If not, consider writing down what is keeping you from doing so, and pick a start date to begin following all three rules. The following sections explain how to do so, and why these rules are so important.\\n\\n1.  **\\"Live within your means\\"** is a key rule of financial fitness. It entails a strong commitment that you will not spend more than you can afford, so that when there is something that you really want to buy - a car, fishing gear, a trip - you recognize that you will need to take the time to build up your savings before buying it. This requires patience; however, it is well worth waiting a few weeks or months to make a large purchase without going into debt, when compared to the stress and worry that goes along with carrying a balance on a high-interest credit card. More on this later. \\n2.  **\\"Make a budget and stick to it\\"** is closely related to \\"Living within your means.\\" This involves writing down how much money you make each month, then creating a list of essential expenses (housing, utilities, groceries, insurance), and adding in expenses for optional but enjoyable activities (going out to dinner, travel). As long as your expenses are less than your take-home pay, you are living within your means. However, it is easy for new spending to creep in and become a regular expense. For example, going out to eat more frequently than you planned can add up quickly each month. Upgrading to a nicer car, getting premium cable instead of basic, or buying a new smartphone with a high monthly payment can increase monthly expenses by hundreds of dollars, eating away at the monthly paycheck - and potentially consuming more than your paycheck can cover (this is when credit cards can be tempting but dangerous). You can take charge of your financial health with a review of your current monthly expenses by going over bank statements and credit card statements, and identifying and categorizing expenses. You can then prioritize where you want your money to go, identify any expenses that are unnecessary, and make a plan for how you will handle them. This may involve canceling an expensive cable TV package, cutting back on how often you go out to eat, or making more affordable shopping choices. Sticking to a budget doesn't mean that you have to deprive yourself of enjoyment - you can build your favorite activities into your budget by listing these expenses and planning in advance for them. If you know you want season tickets for a team you follow, figure out how much that will cost, how much extra income you have each month, and then calculate how many months it would take to save up the cost of the ticket. The same applies to saving up for a down payment on a car or a house or saving up for a trip you'd like to take. As long as you plan for it in advance, saving up over time can allow you to afford many things you would like to do, and without the stress of taking on crippling debt. There are many free or low-cost budgeting software programs and smartphone apps. One of the most highly recommended budgeting apps, [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), is available for free. Mint helps you create a personal budget, keeps track of your bills, and will alert you if an upcoming bill has not yet been paid. This app integrates information across your bank accounts and credit cards to provide a comprehensive picture of your financial activities. It even will alert you if you start going over budget. [GoodBudget](https://goodbudget.com/) is a budgeting app that allows couples to manage their budget together, although it can also work for an individual. The basic version of the app is free, while a more advanced version currently costs about $5 per month. [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (You Need a Budget) also allows couples to co-budget and uses an \\"envelope\\" principle, where money is devoted to different expense categories (like a digital version of putting a fixed amount of money in one envelope for groceries, another for utilities, another for rent, and so on). This makes it easy to spot where you may be spending too much and can help you get back on track if it happens. YNAB is currently about $7 per month.\\n3.  **\\"Pay off credit cards every month\\"** - the third crucial rule, is also closely related to the first two. As long as you follow the first two rules, you should be able to zero out your credit card payments each month. This is very important because most credit cards have high interest rates. Although you may not notice it, the interest on unpaid credit card balances can grow so much that you may end up paying more in interest than you do for the original purchases. Here's an example: If you have a credit card balance of $5,000 that you don't pay off, with an interest rate of 14%, there would be $700 in accrued interest in the first year ($5,000 times 14% = $700). And after paying the $700 over the first year (about $59 each month) you would still owe the entire $5,000 balance. Unless you like the idea of sending credit card companies $50, $100, or more each month in interest charges, make it a top priority to pay your credit card balance to zero. **Every. Single. Month.** If you find that your credit card balance has grown to more than you can pay off in a given month, take a look again at rules 1 and 2 above to ensure that you are living within your means and that you have a budget that you can follow. Prioritize your spending, and make adjustments as necessary to get yourself living within your means and following your budget.\\n\\nIf you follow rules 1-3 you will likely have some extra money each month. If used wisely, you can grow even modest amounts of extra money each month into enough money to retire early, take trips that you can't afford now, and put your children through college. Believe it or not, **saving a million dollars is a very reasonable goal.** Almost anyone can save up a million dollars, as long as they have enough time. \\n\\n**The key factors in saving a million dollars are:**   \\n\\n1.  How much money you start with \\n2.  What rate of return you earn on the investment \\n3.  How long you have the money invested \\n4.

Have three to six months of expenses saved in case of an emergency.\\n\\n**Set Goals**\\n\\nHave a vacation coming up? Need a new car? Set financial savings goals. \\n\\n**_Calculate how much you will need to save and when you will need the money._**\\n\\nThis will help you calculate how much you will need to save each month to reach your goal.\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/screenshotfinance.jpg)\\n\\n**Plan For Retirement**\\n\\nWhether you have a pension plan, a 401(k), or other retirement plans, think about when you want to retire, how much you will need to retire comfortably, and what expenses you will need to cover in retirement. \\n\\n*   Talk to your human resources personnel for more information about retirement planning. \\n*   Utilize online pension calculators such as the National Conference of State Legislatures. These show specifics on what age you can retire, how many years of service are required before retirement, and other nuances of your state's pension plan. \\n*   Consider other forms of savings for retirement. There was a reported $968 billion gap between what the United States' state-run retirement systems promised to pay workers and what funds were actually available.   \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/budget%20bascis.jpg)\\n\\nCreating a budget is essential.

Understanding what is healthy and how to teach your family about good eating habits can be challenging given the constant cycle of fad diets and changing food pyramids. With some simple preparation, you and your family can be on track for a healthier lifestyle. Recognizing the important link between nutrition and officer and family health and wellness can lead to better job performance, healthier individuals and families, and safer communities. \\n\\n**Be Aware of the Link Between Stress & Food**\\n\\nBe mindful of the connection between stress-work and life and the food you consume. Choose healthy food options in times of stress to lead to clearer thinking, increased energy, and better overall health. It is common to choose \\"comfort foods\\" with increased fat and/or sugar content in times of stress, regardless of hunger - particularly officers under physical or emotional distress. The FDA recommends limiting added sugars provided no nutritional value. This is roughly equivalent to: 6.5 slices of frozen pepperoni pizza, 3 glazed doughnuts, 1.5 cups of apple juice, or 3.3 cinnamon raisin bagels. \\n\\n**Practice good coping skills to manage your stress levels.**\\n\\nModel good relationships with food to your family and encourage young children to do the same. Find other outlets for stress - healthy amounts of exercise, journaling, or other relaxing activities. Make these fun family activities. Try having a fun family movie night, go on a bike ride, or coo, dinner together as a stress reliever. \\n\\n**Eat Healthy on the Job**\\n\\nEat healthy while on the job can be particularly challenging given the unpredictability of law enforcement duties. Advance planning and thoughtful discussions of the realities of shift work can assist in better eating habits while on the job. Assemble a week's worth of meals in advance to make it easier to eat healthy when facing an unpredictable and often shifting schedule. Having easy, healthy meal options ready is especially important for night shift officers who may not have the same access to restaurants and grocery stores during their shift. Spend time each week planning out meals, grocery shopping, and cooking lunches, dinners of midnight meals. make meal planning and preparation a family event - it can be fun. Not only does this help your family prepare for the week ahead but it offers an opportunity to model good eating habits to your children. \\n\\n**Keep healthy snacks in your car, desk, or bike.**\\n\\nAlmonds, a low sugar granola bar, or a banana can help tide you over until you can get a filling, nutritious meal rather than settling for the drive-through. \\n\\n**Have some go-to healthy options at local restaurants.**\\n\\nSometimes you need to buy meals for the day, having a list of favorite, healthy meal options at local restaurants and grocery stores makes choosing a nutritious option easier. \\n\\n**Inquire** at local convenience stores for access to a microwave or toaster oven to heat up your meals when you are out on the job. \\n\\n**Establish an eating routine, to include a break from the stress of your job.**\\n\\nGet out of your car, off your bike, or out of the office when you eat to train your brain to have a set meal time - free of distractions and to encourage healthy food consumption. \\n\\n**Eat Healthy at Home**\\n\\nEating healthy at home can be nearly as challenging as eating healthy at work. Setting family routines when you can and being flexible with your shift schedule can lead to healthier family meals.\\n\\n**Make cooking a family event.**\\n\\nCreate a family cookbook of favorite, healthy recipes for quick family meals. Law enforcement is at a higher risk of obesity than civilians. Healthy eating is an important part of overall health and wellness.\\n\\n**Make a take-out favorite at home.**\\n\\nHomemade pizza of mac and cheese can be just as satisfying as the take-out version and you know all the ingredients that go into it. \\n\\n**Try new recipes regularly.**\\n\\nYou might just find your new favorite meal. \\n\\n**Create a family dinner routine.**\\n\\nRoutinely having family meals are linked to reduced childhood obesity. Make family dinner a device-free zone, to promote family connectedness, and distraction-free eating. \\n\\n**How Can You Create a Healthy Lifestyle**\\n\\nBeing healthy is more than just working out or excluding all fatty or sugary foods. Find a balance in your diet, exercise, and remember it is about an overall healthy lifestyle, not a temporary diet. \\n\\n**Focus on variety**\\n\\n*   Try new foods as a family \\n*   Choose greater variety in your food-color, nutritional makeup, ingredient makeup-this can lead to higher energy levels, which is crucial for long and unpredictable shits. \\n*   Aim for as many fruits and vegetables as you can. They make for an easy on-the-go snack to keep with you in the patrol car or in the precinct. \\n*   Remember the less processed your food is, the better it is for you. If the food can go bad, it's probably good for you. \\n\\n**Learn and Teach Your Family to Read Nutrition Labels**\\n\\nRecommended fluid intake: 15.5 cups for men, 11.5 cups for women\\n\\n**Use your thirst level as a preliminary guide for fluid intake, although your need for fluids depends on:**\\n\\n*   Climate, including the temperature and humidity you are in \\n*   Exertion levels, sweating means you need more fluids.\\n*   Overall health, certain medical conditions, including obesity and high blood pressure, require more water intake \\n\\n**Keep in mind how your uniform might make you sweat or overheat more easily.**\\n\\nDrinking lots of fluids can help keep you hydrated underneath your heavy vest or tactical gear. \\n\\n**Don't drink your calories.**\\n\\nDrinks have a lot of hidden sugars and are a major contributor to obesity. Water is the most ideal fluid as it has zero calories and no added sugars or fats. \\n\\n**Carry a refillable water bottle with you to promote more water consumption throughout your day.**\\n\\n*   Make it a family challenge \\n*   Who can get to their recommended water intake the earliest, or who can drink only water throughout the day, no other beverages \\n*   Decorate or buy fun family water bottles.

Sleep is essential to maintain and repair bodily functions and systems. Sleep, or lack of, has effects on all functions of the mind and body, which not only affects an officer's job, but also family wellness.\\n\\n**Effects of Sleep Deprivation on the Body**\\n\\n**Decreased cognitive processes, problem-solving, concentration, and reasoning.**\\n\\nLack of sleep inhibits decision-making, interferes with forming sound judgments, and induces poor assessments due to increased irritability.\\n\\n**Lack of appetite control.**\\n\\nSleep deprivation has shown to increase feelings of hunger and affect a person's ability to judge portion size. \\n\\n**Impaired alertness.**\\n\\nSleep deprivation impairs an individual's ability to remain focused and alert for long periods of time. \\n\\n**Increased risk for heart disease.**\\n\\nSleep-deprived persons are at a higher risk for heart disease and high blood pressure when only sleeping five to six hours a night. \\n\\n**Spatial disorientation.**\\n\\nSleep-deprived persons are more likely to become disoriented when navigating, and often report slower reaction times.\\n\\n**Sleep deprivation can be dangerous.**\\n\\nMore than 40 percent of police officers reported having fallen asleep while driving. 25 percent reported that happened more than once a month. \\n\\n**Working the Night Shift**\\n\\nOur bodies naturally relax and cool down when it gets dark outside and become alert when the sun is up. \\n\\n_Working second or third shift can disrupt the circadian clock and make sleep more difficult._ \\n\\nWorking against the natural rhythms of the body can cause sleep disorders and fatigue. \\n\\nLaw enforcement is a 24-hour job and for many, working the night shift is unavoidable. Learning how to adapt to the schedule and demands of the job can help combat some of the potentially dangerous symptoms of working the night shift. \\n\\n**If you work a permanent night shift:**\\n\\n*   It is best to slowly shift your circadian clock enough to still be able to function on days off.\\n*   The best way to do this is on days off, go to sleep as late as possible and sleep as late as possible. \\n*   On a workday, minimize the sunlight exposure on the drive home by wearing sunglasses and utilize blackout curtains when trying to sleep \\n\\n**If you work rotating night shifts:**\\n\\n*   The circadian clock can't shift fast enough to keep up with a rotation.\\n*   The American Psychological Association recommends avoiding symptomatic relief; caffeine to stay awake at night and sedatives to sleep during the day. These methods can be the day. These methods can be dangerous and only temporarily disrupt your circadian clock.\\n\\n**What Can Officers Do?**\\n\\n_Practice a healthy lifestyle_\\n\\n*   Maintaining balanced eating habits\\n*   Refrain from tobacco use\\n*   Limit alcohol consumption \\n*   Exercise regularly \\n*   Have an annual physical \\n*   Exercise proper sleep hygiene\\n*   Get seven to nine hours of sleep every night \\n*   Limit caffeine intake close to sleep time\\n*   Minimize screen time before bed \\n\\n**How Can Family Help?**\\n\\n**Assist in making the sleeping space more comfortable and appealing.**\\n\\n*   Black-out curtains, minimal electronics, supportive pillows and mattress, and a comfortable temperature are all ways to help with sleep.\\n*   The ideal temperature for a room to sleep in is 60-67F.\\n*   Suggested addition: Minimize activity in the house when the officer is trying to sleep.\\n*   Encourage your partner to talk to a doctor about his/her sleeping habits, particularly if s/he snores frequently, has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or begins to show other health concerns. \\n\\n**Create a family bedtime ritual.**\\n\\n*   Calming and relaxing environments help decrease stress and anxiety making falling asleep and staying asleep easier. \\n*   One hour before you go to sleep have a \\"wind-down\\" hour. Do calming activities such as reading or taking a relaxing bath or shower. this is the crucial time to avoid electronic screens that can increase restlessness.\\n\\n**Get into a routine as much as possible.**\\n\\n*   Eating on a regular schedule and going to sleep and waking up on a regular schedule, no matter what the schedule is, all decrease the effects of sleep deprivation. \\n*   Communicate with family and friends to help distribute family responsibilities, such as sports practices, carpools, and grocery shopping. \\n\\n**Exercise regularly.**\\n\\n*   Vigorous exercise can make it easier to fall asleep.

4e20218d-3435-4b13-9ef8-69bd5d1b6ee2	LE - Financial Fitness - Additional Guidelines	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Additional Guidelines**\\n\\n\\nInvest for the future (savings, retirement, college for children) as early as you can, and contribute every month, even if the amounts are small.\\n\\nWhile it can be easy to think that you should wait until later to start thinking about retirement or other investments, the sooner you start regularly putting away even small amounts of money into a savings or investment account, the larger these returns will grow over time. If you wait until you have a large amount of money to invest, you will lose out on one of the most important variables in investing: time. Even small amounts of money invested can grow to a million dollars, given enough time. Take a look at this graph below comparing an officer who began investing $500 per month at age 25, with one who began investing at age 35. This graph shows how much they both will have at age 50, assuming an average rate of return of 9% per year. Starting earlier made a huge difference in this case – $553,943 for the officer who started at age 25, compared with $192,020 for the officer who started 10 years later.\\n\\n\\\\[Financial Fitness Chart 1\\\\]\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/Graph12.png)  \\n\\n**Start Early!**\\n\\nIt doesn’t take much to set up an investment account (although it is important to spend some time to make sure your account involves low-cost investment options and does not take a large management fee). Once you have an investment account set up, set up an automatic withdrawal plan so that money is moved into your investment account without needing to remember to do so. Your bank also likely has an option to automatically transfer a monthly amount for your paycheck deposit into a dedicated savings account. Both of these options can help you grow your wealth with a minimum of effort.\\n\\n**Rate of Return on Investment**\\n\\nFinancial experts recommend that you have cash savings that equal 3-6 months of salary, and that you build up savings in cash or other stable assets (like Treasury bills) for expenses that you expect to have in the next 3-5 years. For example, if you are planning to put a $5,000 down payment on a house in six months, the $5,000 should be in cash. Although cash savings earns almost no interest, it is very stable. In comparison, stocks have the potential to earn much higher rates of return, but they also can drop significantly in value. For this reason, you should invest in stocks and similar assets only after you have enough savings in cash to cover immediate and near-term expenses.\\n\\nAt the same time, if you leave all of your assets in cash, or in low-risk, low-return assets like Treasury bills, bonds, or certificates of deposit (CDs), they will grow very little over time, because the rate of return is so low. For this reason, it is recommended that your long-term investments include a significant amount of stocks (also called equities). For the best long-term gains, the easiest path is to invest primarily in low-fee Stock Index Funds. Stock index funds on average earn much larger returns than stable, but low-return assets like cash, treasury bills, CDs, or bonds. Although the value of stocks can fluctuate significantly, losing 10-15% some years, gaining 15-25% some years, over the past 100 years the average annual rate of return on the [S&P 500 Index](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFINX) has been about 10%.\\n\\nThis higher rate of return is important because of compound growth. At 10%, $1,000 becomes $1,100 after a year ($1000 x .10 = $100, which is added to the original $1,000). The $1,100 then becomes $1,210 at the end of year two, which becomes $1,331 after year three, and so on. By year eight it has grown to $2,144 – more than double the original amount.\\n\\nThe graph below illustrates the importance of the rate of return on investment. Here we see two individuals investing $500 per month, starting at the same time, and investing for 25 years. The only difference is that one is invested in primarily stocks, and earns an average 9% rate of return, while the other earns an average 3% rate of return by investing only in low-risk, low-return assets like bonds and CDs. Over 25 years the difference in accumulated wealth is striking – $553,943 compared to $225,318.\\n\\n\\\\[Financial Fitness Chart 2\\\\]\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/Graph2.png)\\n\\nAlthough there are many options for low-expense index funds, Vanguard has been a leader in establishing index funds across a range of sectors. Easy choices would include their S&P 500 Index fund, which tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a composite of many large U.S. companies.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that index funds are such a great idea is that they are very low cost because they do not pay an expensive fund manager to make all sorts of decisions about which stocks to invest in, when to sell them, and so on. And even though they keep costs low by simply investing in the companies that make up the S&P 500 Index, the performance of index funds beats the performance of (more expensive) actively managed funds more than 70% of the time. It’s rare that you can get better performance at a low cost, but index funds are one case where this has been shown to be true year after year.\\n\\nWhen you are many years from retirement, investment primarily in stock-based mutual funds. Be sure to diversify, because this means that if one sector of the economy (like tech or energy) has a slump, you will still own stock in other sectors. In addition, diversify across regions. Your investments should include US stocks (like an S&P 500 Index Fund) but also stocks outside of the US (International or Global funds, excluding US stocks, such as Vanguard FTSE All-World excluding-US Index Fund Admiral (VFWAX)). It is also useful to include small- and mid-sized companies, and so you can further diversify by including Small-Cap (smaller companies) and Mid-Cap (medium-sized companies) Index funds. Examples include the [Fidelity Small-Cap Index Fund](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146182) (FSSNX), and the [Fidelity Spartan Mid Cap Index Fund](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146265) (FSMDX).\\n\\nThe remainder of your portfolio should include more stable assets including bond funds, inflation-protected US Treasuries, as well as REITs (real-estate investment trusts). These allow for further diversification and protect against large market slumps.\\n\\nIdeally, some or most of your investment should be in a tax-advantaged retirement account such as an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). (Note that anything you want to use at a younger age should not be placed in an IRA or 401k, as there are penalties for early withdrawal). Most agencies will have some sort of retirement plan set up, and so this will certainly be an important part of your overall investments. But you can also make additional contributions to an IRA, which can result in significant tax savings because the amount that you contribute to a regular IRA will not be subject to tax in the year that you make the contribution.\\n\\nFunds that you invest in an IRA separately from the retirement benefits that your employer offers will increase your total savings at retirement. It should be noted that under current IRS rules you cannot withdraw IRA funds before age 59 ½ without having to pay a penalty. However, whatever amount you can invest into an IRA will make your retirement all the sweeter and more secure. You can also invest in non-IRA investment accounts, and you would have access to these funds whenever you like.\\n\\n**Amount Invested: Contribute as Much as Possible** \\n\\nThe examples above have assumed a monthly investment of $500 per month. Depending on your situation, you may be able to invest more or less than $500 per month. Whatever the amount, investing early and regularly can result in very large returns over time. However, the more you are able to invest each month, the greater your returns. The graph below compares the amount accumulated at age 50, with both individuals starting at age 25 and both earning 9% average annual returns. The bar on the left shows returns when $500/month is invested, compared to returns for $100/month on the right. Investing $100 each month results in $110,788, which is a great outcome with relatively little effort. But notice that stretching to invest $500 each month makes a very large difference at age 50, totaling $553,943.

The relatively minor effort involved in living within your means, making a budget and sticking with it, and paying off credit cards every month will repay itself many times over in avoiding the distress and distraction that go along with constant worrying about going deeper into debt, or not having enough savings to cover expenses. One nice feature of financial fitness is that after you have set up your budget and plan for savings, relatively little time is required to maintain it. You begin to follow your budget plan, and it becomes a habit. You set up an automatic debit plan to regularly put money in savings and investments, and it works in the background, without any effort on your part. If you haven’t already done so, block out an hour or so on your days off to first set up your budget and make a plan to keep your credit cards paid off each month. Then block off 30 minutes or an hour each week until you have worked through the remaining steps, including setting up an investment account with automatic contributions, making sure you have adequate insurance. Once all is set up, it will take very little time to follow and maintain.\\n\\nImagine the difference in family relationships for an officer who follows these guidelines, compared with an officer who overspends, has high credit card debt, and has to worry each month about whether the bills can be covered. Financial fitness affects family fitness – by getting a grip on budgeting and savings, you can promote less stress and greater harmony at home.\\n\\nAnd this extends to your physical health as well. Avoiding the stress of worrying about bills and debt has benefits including lower blood pressure, improved immune functioning, reduced anxiety, and enhanced mood.

Start by writing out your various goals at work, home, and personal interests. Select the goal that you consider your top priority the one that it's important to put in the most effort and would give you real pride from progress. Once you have selected your top priority, make yourself laser-focused on achieving that goal by eliminating (temporarily) all of the other goals. Once you achieve the top priority goal, you can then take on the next goal on the list, and so on.\\n\\nWorking on only one goal at a time allows you to bring all of your focus and energy to working on this goal, maximizing your ability to succeed. For example, your goals may include training to run a 10k, and improving your relationship with your spouse. If you try to take on both at the same time, you will likely not have enough hours of running per week to train adequately and might feel under-prepared as race day approaches. During training runs, you may feel guilty for not spending more time on your relationship with your spouse. Then, when you set aside quality time to focus on the relationship with your spouse, you may feel frustrated or resentful that you did not have enough time for a training run. This, of course, will undermine your goal of strengthening your relationship with your spouse. Far better instead to focus completely on achieving one goal at a time, without distraction. Working on more than one goal at the same time dilutes focus, uses up limited time, and offers the opportunity to fall short on several goals at the same time.

For example, the death from an extended illness of an elderly retired colleague who you knew only casually may trigger only a mild sense of grief, or perhaps only sympathy for his family. In contrast, the sudden death of a partner or close colleague in the line of duty would cause much more intense feelings of grief, both because of the closeness of the relationship, and because the sudden nature of the death gives no time to anticipate and prepare for the event.\\n\\nThe most devastating type of loss for many is the death of their own child, or a young close relative. Compared with the death of an elderly person, the death of a young child triggers more intense emotions because their future has been cut short, depriving them of the important life experiences most of us expect. In addition, the desire to protect the vulnerable is especially strong when it comes to children.\\n\\nIn any case, there is no single \\"correct\\" way to feel after learning that someone has died. Stronger than expected feelings may emerge if the deceased reminds you of someone important to you. Conversely, the passing of a cherished and highly respected colleague or family member may evoke much less intense emotions than expected if the person was elderly, or if your esteem and respect for the colleague did not translate to feeling close or connected with them.

Of course, all officers and correctional staff are human beings before they are officers or staff, and have emotional responses hard-wired in to their very being. And so it is important to accept that, as strong and controlled as you may be, losing someone close to you will activate strong, painful emotions, just as it will for every other first responder, however tough and strong they may appear on the surface.\\n\\nRecognizing and accepting that you, like every other first responder, will be affected by loss, is important. First, it can be bewildering to feel overcome by waves of grief when you may have thought that you had dealt with your emotions in the initial period after the loss. Feeling the sudden onset of grief is painful enough in itself, but may be worsened if you believe strongly that you should be past these emotions, or that you must control and mask these emotions in order to appear strong. Having this internal struggle while on duty may distract you, making you less effective and less able to think clearly in demanding situations. Because of this, it is helpful to anticipate that intense feelings of grief may arise unexpectedly, so that the experience will be less distressing and less distracting. It can also be helpful to know in advance that these strong feelings arrive like a wave, but also recede like a wave, and so will usually reduce within several minutes. Another important reason for recognizing and understanding the nature of grief is so that you can sidestep some of the harmful ways that some people try to avoid painful emotions after loss. A very common trap is to use alcohol as a way to escape the ache of grief. Alcohol temporarily numbs emotions, and so provides a brief escape from pain. However, this creates two significant problems. First, increasingly more alcohol will likely be needed to keep the pain away; this can lead to catastrophic outcomes if the influence of alcohol is present while on duty. Second, using alcohol to numb grief and other emotions related to loss prevents these emotions from being processed, so that the grief remains unresolved for a longer, extended period of time. As a result, effectiveness at work may be reduced, and relationships with important others may become compromised, and intense grief remains longer. Understanding the nature of grief can help you keep from having your career and relationships sidelined when you suffer a loss. \\n\\nSome people also try to avoid the pain of grief through distraction, either by working longer hours, or taking on additional responsibilities, or otherwise staying busy. While it is very useful to eventually become engaged in the world again after a loss, if the purpose of doing so is to avoid painful emotions and memories, this will likely have the effect of prolonging the grieving process. Stuffing or burying grief through business denies the brain time to process the loss, longing, grief, or remorse. This type of coping can increase the likelihood that problems will emerge in relationships and at work, and that depression or other problems may develop.

You can try to simply observe the sensations and emotions, and allow them to fade. You can also bring the panic attack to an end more quickly by engaging in slow, deep diaphragmatic breathing (or belly breathing). You can practice this form of breathing when you are not having a panic attack, so that in the future you will be more familiar with this skill and so can use it more easily. While seated, place your hand on your belly, and breath in so that your stomach expands outward as you breathe in. Breathe slowly, counting 4 seconds as you inhale, then 6 seconds as you exhale, pausing briefly before inhaling again. Your hand on your belly will help you to continue with more relaxed, belly breathing, instead of the shallower breathing from the chest that tends to occur when tense or anxious. By practicing this belly breathing, you can develop greater control over the rate of your breathing, so that if you notice anxious, panic-like sensations, such as shortness of breath, you can remember to engage in this breathing exercise, if the situation allows. Another benefit of practicing belly breathing periodically is that it allows you to store memories of the physical feelings of deep relaxation and calm breathing. When you are in a stressful situation and beginning to feel tense, you can activate the memory of feeling calm and deeply relaxed, and this can help you to become calmer, so that you think more clearly and respond more effectively.", "title": "Breathing Exercises", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 18:08:01.805525+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 18:08:01.805525+00	\N	f

One involves focusing on the lost loved one, experiencing the pain of their absence, reviewing memories of time spent with them, and experiencing the feelings of grief. This involves looking back in time, at how life was before the loss. The other process is more forward looking, and involves beginning to re-engage with an environment that is changed by the absence of the loved one; beginning to focus more on tending to relationships with other family and friends, and beginning to try out and redefine new roles and new ways of living in a world without the loved one.\\n\\nSome of these processes will simply occur naturally, as memories of the loved one emerge spontaneously, leading to periods of reflecting on the past and grieving the loss. And for most people, there will be a natural shift towards adapting to the change that the loss has created. There is typically an alternation back and forth between these experiences – waves of grief, which gradually become less frequent, followed by increasingly longer periods of acceptance and becoming more involved in continuing with relationships and working towards goals. For some people, this process may be delayed by attempts to avoid the strong emotions, either by trying to stay distracted with work or other activities, or by using alcohol or medications to numb the feelings. Because this pattern of avoiding emotions can have harmful effects to relationships and to performance while working, it is important to recognize when this may be happening, and take control of the situation. A valuable first step would be to consult with a behavioral health specialist about effective ways of coping with loss. One or two brief consultations can provide you with effective tools to keep you on a healthy track as you deal with the grief. At the same time, finding your way through the grief can be helped by setting deliberate times to focus your attention and your emotions on the lost loved one – Looking Back. This can include picking a time each day to speak out loud to the deceased, either about current things you wish you could share with them, or telling them things you regret not saying when they were alive. This may even be in the form of an imagined dialogue, in which you fill in what you expect they would say if alive. This period of planned time could also take the form of writing a letter or many letters to the deceased, expressing what you believe you still need to express to them. Whether through speaking or writing letters to the deceased, part of the purpose of these activities is to spend time remembering the loved one and grieving their absence. \\n\\nAnother important purpose is to begin to recognize and fully acknowledge the finality of this loss; that they are in your memories, but no longer physically in your daily life. This can be a very painful experience, especially initially, and it is useful to have friends or family available for support during this time. Across time, the intensity of the emotional pain will begin to reduce, as acknowledgment and acceptance of the loss becomes more deeply established. It is important to recognize that you can continue to love and honor and cherish the lost loved one, even as the pain of the loss fades. Feeling less pain over their loss does not mean loving them any less. It is important to also plan times to Look Forward. This involves beginning to re-engage with the world, after it has been changed by the loss. This may mean an environment that no longer has a close work partner, or spouse, or family member. The task is to begin to resume making plans, developing new goals and working towards them, and even beginning to dream new experiences to look forward to, while beginning to accommodate the absence of the loved one. \\n\\nDepending on the nature of the loss, you may need to alternate between Looking Back and Looking Forward many times before beginning to feel “normal” – or adjusting to a “new normal” without the loved one. What seems to be most useful in working through loss is to have periods of revisiting the loss, and bringing forward the memories and intense emotions related to the loss; and then shifting to a “restoration” perspective, with a focus on resuming current responsibilities, tending to current relationships, and focusing on new goals that accommodate the reality of the loss of the loved one. \\n\\nScheduled times for Looking Back can include writing letters to the loved one, going through photos, sorting their belongings, or carrying out an imagined conversation. Scheduled times for Looking Forward may involve writing down goals you would like to achieve, enjoyable activities to pursue, or new skills you would like to learn. A barrier for some people in recovering from grief is the idea that if they begin to participate fully in life again, or find enjoyment, that they are somehow betraying or dishonoring the loved one. By spending time remembering and reminiscing about the loved one, you can continue to honor and cherish the person, even as you move forward in re-engaging in the world without them.", "title": "Looking Back, Looking Forward", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 13:42:26.510676+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 13:42:26.510676+00	\N	f

This leads them to avoid taking on goals that would require them to stretch beyond their comfort zone; as a result, they often perform below their true potential.\\n\\nOnce you realize that most aspects of skilled human performance involve mostly trial and error, practice and experience, you will be well on your way to having a growth mindset.

Across 22 occupational categories, protective services occupations (e.g., law enforcement officers and firefighters) were associated with the #1 highest rate of suicides amongst females and the #6 highest rate of suicides amongst males. The Center for Disease Control MMWR article additionally reported:\\n\\n**_“Research has suggested that higher suicide rates among police are related to stressors including exposure to traumatic, violent, and lethal situations; work overload; shift work; and access to lethal means. Females in protective service occupations might also experience additional stressors in these traditionally male-dominated occupations.”_**\\n\\nSuicide does not discriminate. People of all genders, ages, and ethnicities can be at risk for suicide. But people most at risk tend to share certain characteristics. The main risk factors for suicide are: \\n\\n*   Depression, other mental disorders, or substance abuse disorder \\n*   A prior suicide attempt \\n*   Family history of a mental disorder or substance abuse \\n*   Family history of suicide \\n*   Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse \\n*   Having guns or other firearms in the home Incarceration, being in prison or jail \\n*   Being exposed to others’ suicidal behavior, such as that of family members, peers, or media figures\\n\\nThe risk for suicidal behavior is complex. Research suggests that people who attempt suicide differ from others in many aspects of how they think, react to events, and make decisions. There are differences in aspects of memory, attention, planning, and emotion, for example. These differences often occur along with disorders like depression, substance use, anxiety, and psychosis. Sometimes suicidal behavior is triggered by events such as personal loss or violence. In order to be able to detect those at risk and prevent suicide, it is crucial that we understand the role of both long-term factors – such as experiences in childhood – and more immediate factors like mental health and recent life events. Researchers are also looking at how genes can either increase risk or make someone more resilient to loss and hardships. Many people have some of these risk factors but do not attempt suicide. Suicide is not a normal response to stress. **It is however, a sign of extreme distress, not a harmless bid for attention.**", "title": "Who is at Risk for Suicide?", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 19:18:20.66856+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:14:19.341939+00	\N	f

Of course, all first responders are human beings before they are first responders, and have emotional responses hard-wired into their very being. And so it is important to accept that, as strong and controlled as you may be, losing someone close to you will activate strong, painful emotions, just as it will for every other first responder, however tough and strong they may appear on the surface.\\n\\nRecognizing and accepting that you, like every other first responder, will be affected by loss, is important. First, it can be bewildering to feel overcome by waves of grief when you may have thought that you had dealt with your emotions in the initial period after the loss. Feeling the sudden onset of grief is painful enough in itself, but may be worsened if you believe strongly that you should be past these emotions, or that you must control and mask these emotions in order to appear strong. Having this internal struggle while on duty may distract you, making you less effective and less able to think clearly in demanding situations. Because of this, it is helpful to anticipate that intense feelings of grief may arise unexpectedly so that the experience will be less distressing and less distracting. It can also be helpful to know in advance that these strong feelings arrive like a wave, but also recede like a wave, and so will usually reduce within several minutes. Another important reason for recognizing and understanding the nature of grief is so that you can sidestep some of the harmful ways that some people try to avoid painful emotions after a loss. A very common trap is to use alcohol as a way to escape the ache of grief. Alcohol temporarily numbs emotions, and so provides a brief escape from pain. However, this creates two significant problems. First, increasingly more alcohol will likely be needed to keep the pain away; this can lead to catastrophic outcomes if the influence of alcohol is present while on duty. Second, using alcohol to numb grief and other emotions related to loss prevents these emotions from being processed, so that the grief remains unresolved for a longer, extended period of time. As a result, effectiveness at work may be reduced, and relationships with important others may become compromised, and intense grief remains longer. Understanding the nature of grief can help you keep from having your career and relationships sidelined when you suffer a loss. The next section describes helpful ways of coping with grief.  \\n\\nSome people also try to avoid the pain of grief through distraction, either by working longer hours, or taking on additional responsibilities, or otherwise staying busy. While it is very useful to eventually become engaged in the world again after a loss, if the purpose of doing so is to avoid painful emotions and memories, this will likely have the effect of prolonging the grieving process. Stuffing or burying grief through business denies the brain time to process the loss, longing, grief, or remorse. This type of coping can increase the likelihood that problems will emerge in relationships and at work, and that depression or other problems may develop.

One involves focusing on the lost loved one, experiencing the pain of their absence, reviewing memories of time spent with them, and experiencing the feelings of grief. This involves looking back in time, at how life was before the loss. The other process is more forward-looking, and involves beginning to re-engage with an environment that is changed by the absence of the loved one; beginning to focus more on tending to relationships with other family and friends, and beginning to try out and redefine new roles and new ways of living in a world without the loved one.\\n\\nSome of these processes will simply occur naturally, as memories of the loved one emerge spontaneously, leading to periods of reflecting on the past and grieving the loss. And for most people, there will be a natural shift towards adapting to the change that the loss has created. There is typically an alternation back and forth between these experiences – waves of grief, which gradually become less frequent, followed by increasingly longer periods of acceptance and becoming more involved in continuing with relationships and working towards goals. For some people, this process may be delayed by attempts to avoid strong emotions, either by trying to stay distracted with work or other activities or by using alcohol or medications to numb the feelings. Because this pattern of avoiding emotions can have harmful effects on relationships and performance while on duty, it is important to recognize when this may be happening and take control of the situation. A valuable first step would be to consult with a behavioral health specialist about effective ways of coping with loss. One or two brief consultations can provide you with effective tools to keep you on a healthy track as you deal with the grief. At the same time, finding your way through the grief can be helped by setting deliberate times to focus your attention and your emotions on the lost loved one – Looking Back. This can include picking a time each day to speak out loud to the deceased, either about current things you wish you could share with them, or telling them things you regret not saying when they were alive. This may even be in the form of imagined dialogue, in which you fill in what you expect they would say if alive. This period of planned time could also take the form of writing a letter or many letters to the deceased, expressing what you believe you still need to express to them. Whether through speaking or writing letters to the deceased, part of the purpose of these activities is to spend time remembering the loved one and grieving their absence. \\n\\nAnother important purpose is to begin to recognize and fully acknowledge the finality of this loss; that they are in your memories, but no longer in your daily life. This can be a very painful experience, especially initially, and it is useful to have friends or family available for support during this time. Over time, the intensity of the emotional pain will begin to reduce, as acknowledgment and acceptance of the loss become more deeply established. It is important to recognize that you can continue to love and honor and cherish the lost loved one, even as the pain of the loss fades. Feeling less pain over their loss does not mean loving them any less. It is important to also plan times to Look Forward. This involves beginning to re-engage with the world after it has been changed by the loss. This may mean an environment that no longer has a close work partner, or spouse, or family member. The task is to begin to resume making plans, developing new goals and working towards them, and even beginning to dream new experiences to look forward to while beginning to accommodate the absence of the loved one. \\n\\nDepending on the nature of the loss, you may need to alternate between Looking Back and Looking Forward many times before beginning to feel “normal” – or adjusting to a “new normal” without the loved one. What seems to be most useful in working through loss is to have periods of revisiting the loss, and bringing forward the memories and intense emotions related to the loss; and then shifting to a “restoration” perspective, with a focus on resuming current responsibilities, tending to current relationships, and focusing on new goals that accommodate the reality of the loss of the loved one. \\n\\nScheduled times for Looking Back can include writing letters to the loved one, going through photos, sorting their belongings, or carrying out an imagined conversation. Scheduled times for Looking Forward may involve writing down goals you would like to achieve, enjoyable activities to pursue, or new skills you would like to learn. A barrier for some people in recovering from grief is the idea that if they begin to participate fully in life again, or find enjoyment, that they are somehow betraying or dishonoring the loved one. By spending time remembering and reminiscing about the loved one, you can continue to honor and cherish the person, even as you move forward in re-engaging in the world without them.", "title": "Looking Back, Looking Forward", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:44:26.692179+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:54:02.677934+00	\N	f

07d50b72-ac0f-472b-90c8-c00c616d173e	LE - Suicide Prevention - Messaging About Suicide Prevention	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Messaging About Suicide Prevention**\\n\\n\\n**Strategies for Safe and Positive Messaging**\\n\\nThis was developed through the National Consortium on Prevention Law Enforcement Suicide (the Consortium) and focuses on the importance of safe messaging. Through the Consortium, five task force groups were formed to identify recommendations and considerations for the policing profession as it relates to suicide prevention efforts in an agency or department: messaging, data and research, organization and system change, peer support, and family support. This resource provides information for leadership to use to help promote and support suicide prevention efforts.   \\n  \\n\\n**Why Does Messaging About Suicide Matter?** \\n\\nResearch has shown that messaging about suicide can either increase the risk of suicide and undermine prevention efforts or promote positive behaviors and support prevention goals. There are many complexities to what contributes to suicidal thoughts of behavior in an individual police officer. **Words matter**, and the way a police agency talks about suicide has a significant impact in preventing suicide and encouraging help-seeking behavior for those who may be in crisis. Contrary to best practice recommendations, many messages focus on the specific type, location or graphic descriptions surrounding suicide loss, providing detailed information that is inappropriate for the people hearing the messages. In order to help promote and support prevention efforts, agencies should consider the evidence-based recommendations provided in this toolkit. \\n\\n  \\n**What Is Public Messaging?**\\n\\nPublic messaging is broadly defined as any communications released into the public domain, including internal and external departmental communication through email, newsletters, training, intranet, websites, flyers, social media posts, public presentations, media interviews, press releases, and any other messages or materials to a large group. The guidelines below are not intended to address private conversations, interactions with individuals in crisis, one-on-one conversations including with a chaplain, or interventions with a member of peer support or treatment professional. \\n\\n**What Are The Key Components When Messaging About Suicide?** \\n\\nIn 2014, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance), the nation's public-private partnership for suicide prevention, released the [_Framework for Successful Messaging_](http://suicidepreventionmessaging.org/)_,_ a research-based resource outlining four key components when messaging to the public about suicide. These key components include:   \\n  \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/image.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/image%202.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Start with Strategy**\\n\\nDeveloping a strategy is the first step to any effective communications or messaging effort. Departments should ensure that nay public messaging is strategic and well thought out. To do this, agency leaders can apply the following questions: \\n\\n**What Are The Goals Of The Message?** \\n\\nBe specific with the goals. A broad goal such as \\"raise awareness\\" is not specific enough. Instead, consider a goal like \\"increase the number of officers who utilize our peer support program.\\" \\n\\n**Who Is The Audience?**   \\n\\nMessages targeted too broadly, such as \\"everyone,\\" will not be effective. Each audience will have unique needs that need to be addressed through the messaging. For example, messaging to a recruit will be different than messaging to a command officer. Additionally, developing messages department-wide will be different than messaging to a specific group such as retired officers or officers who identify as LGBTQ+.\\n\\n**What Action/Behavior Is The Audience Being Encouraged To Take?**\\n\\nThe targeted action/behavior the audience is recommended to take should be specific and help the audience take small steps towards a broader goal. For example, a specific action might be \\"learn how to support a fellow officer who may be struggling or in crisis by learning to identify the warning signs of suicide.\\" Consider if the audience is being encouraged or asked to take a specific action or if it is a mandate, such as the department implementing routine mental health check-ins with a professional.\\n\\n**How Does The Messaging Align With Other Programs Or Services?** \\n\\nBe intentional about alignment with programs, services, and the mission of the department. For example, if an agency develops a poster that promotes help-seeking, the agency should include information about available services such as  a peer support program of available crisis lines for officers. Additionally, it can be important to connect mental health programs with physical health programs and overall well-being.   \\n  \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/imagedfsdf.png)  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n**Support Safety**\\n\\nThe language used when talking about suicide is critically important. Evidence corroborates that how we message publicly about suicide can have an impact on suicidal behavior and may put vulnerable populations at increased risk. Messaging that can contribute to increased risk includes providing details about suicide method or location, glamorizing a suicide death, portraying suicide as common or an expected response to adversity, and presenting a simple explanation for a death. Agencies should use terminology stating an officer died by suicide instead of sharing the specific method or location details to officers, the community, or media. It is helpful to communicate that struggles played a role in a suicide death while also not providing a simple explanation. Statements indicating a sole contributing factor to a suicide death should be avoided. One circumstance is often not the only factor which contributed to a suicidal crisis. Also, it can be harmful to communicate or contribute to a perception that suicidal crises are normal among police, as if they are just part of the job, or a common reaction to trauma. Agencies can refrain from glamorizing suicide in their communications by avoiding commenting that the deceased is now \\"free from all suffering.\\" \\n\\nTo help Support safety through all messaging efforts, it is important that agencies: \\n\\n*   **EMPHASIZE** the fact that most people who face adversity do not die by suicide, but instead find support or treatment.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **HIGHLIGHT** that suicide results from a complex interplay of factors and cannot be attributed to once single cause.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **SHARE** stories which focus on thriving, recovery, and healthy coping.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **ADJUST** terminology away from using the word \\"commit\\" which can have a criminal connotation and instead use words such as \\"died by\\" or \\"died of\\" suicide which are more consistent with physical health terms.    \\n      \\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n**Share Positive Stories**\\n\\nBalance the negative aspects of suicide with stories of officers who have sought help and gone on to recover, live, and thrive. Think about how the message will help others envision hope, recovery, and resiliency. Some examples of how you can share positive stories include: \\n\\n*   **TANGIBLE** actions your audience can take, such as knowing the warning signs of suicide risk and reaching out to an officer that is going through a tough time.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **STORIES** of coping and resiliency sharing all ends of the continuum from coping with financial troubles, to bouncing back from a broken arm, to healing from a suicide attempt.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **PROVIDE** available resources such as in-house mental health services, Employee Assistance programs, peer support, chaplain support, community-based resources, and crisis hotlines.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **HOW** people are making a difference, including stories of how personnel in the department are supporting others or found support valuable. \\n\\nThis component is not meant to downplay the seriousness of suicide, but rather apply the evidence that our messaging matters and everyone has a role in balancing the negative aspects of suicide with positive action steps people can take to help prevent suicide.   \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n**Follow Guidelines**\\n\\nThis component recognizes that there are many helpful resources available for specific types of messaging - such as specific channels, like print materials or electronic communications, or specific goals, like increasing resilience. When developing messages, agencies should use guidelines and best practices that are already available. These guidelines and more messaging resources can be found at: \\n\\n[National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Framework for Successful Messaging](http://suicidepreventionmessaging.org/)\\n\\n[IACP Media Relations Considerations Document](https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/Media%20Considerations%20-%202019.pdf)\\n\\n[IACP Social Media Document](https://www.theiacp.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/Social%20Media%20Considerations%20-%202019.pdf)\\n\\n[IACP Blog Post: It's Simply Not Your News to Break](https://www.theiacp.org/news/blog-post/its-simply-not-your-news-to-break-stayinyourlane)  \\n  \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/sdsdfsd.png)  \\n  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n\\n**A Key Component of an Agency-Wide Suicide Prevention Approach**\\n\\nDisseminating appropriate and positive messages is one of the 11 components of the Comprehensive Framework for Law Enforcement Suicide Prevention, a resource of the Consortium that provides law enforcement agencies with comprehensive strategies to support officers through messaging, training, support, connectedness, and more. Below are consideration for messaging by chiefs, command staff, peers, and families of officers. \\n\\n**Chiefs and Command Staff**\\n\\nOfficers know the priorities of their chief and command staff through what an how they communicate personally and through the chain of command and through what they reinforce in action. \\n\\nChiefs and command staff need to communicate that suicide prevention and officer mental health are priorities. Officers need to know that chiefs and command staff are not only saying something, but they want to see that leaders truly mean it, believe it, and are committed to suicide prevention and mental health support. Agency leaders can request feedback to understand how to deliver messages to various ranks, as well as how to reinforce those messages. Starting at the academy, officers are aware that they are analyzed by how they control situations. Leaders must communicate that asking for help is sign of being in control, not a sign of weakness. Communicating that it is normal to experience stress and trauma, and that actively maintaining one's mental health as a part of a career in policing helps to normalize help-seeking behavior. Agencies should make messaging about mental health and suicide prevention routine and talk about it early and often throughout an officer's career. Providing regular messages on the importance of mental health throughout an officer's career will reinforce the commitment to keeping officers safe and well. It is best to include stories of healing, recovery, and resilience, by sharing personal stories and augmenting the voices of peer supporters. Powerful stories of seeking help, surviving a suicidal crisis, managing one's anger, getting support after trauma, and recovering from and addiction normalizes help-seeking, demonstrates the agency has the officer's back, and builds a culture of support for officer mental health.  \\n  \\n\\n**Tips for Chiefs and Command Staff**\\n\\n*   **SHARE** stories of those who have experienced mental health challenges or a suicidal crisis and experienced healing and recovery.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **COMMUNICATE** a positive, hopeful, and resilient, messaging indicating that support is available, treatment is effective, and, in most situations, suicide can be prevented.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **TALK** about mental health and suicide prevention regularly before a critical incident occurs.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **TAILOR** messages to the diverse needs of the audience considering the impact culture may have on mental health challenges.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **CONSULT** a suicide prevention expert when talking with media regarding law enforcement suicide prevention or following a suicide loss.  \\n     \\n*   **EXERCISE** caution when talking about complex issues like what contributed to suicidal behavior. Be careful not to communicate in a way that states an oversimplified cause.\\n\\n  \\n**Front Line Supervisors**\\n\\nSergeants, corporals, and other leaders in roles of supervising personnel wear many heats ranging from being the insulation between line personnel and management, to keeping an eye out for inappropriate behaviors, to working to develop team unity and cohesion. Front line supervisors have a key role in taking care of the members of their team, looking for signs, following up on absences, and referring an officer to Employee Assistance programs or other support when necessary. Sergeants and corporals should remain cognizant of the messages they send about mental health and suicide prevention, how individuals interpret those messages, and the role they play in creating and maintaining a culture of support. Supervisors can make or break a culture of \\"It is okay not to be okay.\\" \\n\\n  \\n**Tips for Front Line Supervisors**\\n\\n*   **COMMUNICATE** that it is okay to focus on and take care of yourself, because ultimately taking care of yourself is taking care of everyone else, including your unit, your family, and your community.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **MODEL** self-care with both action and messages.  \\n     \\n*   **ACT** as a coach when it comes to mental health, if possible and appropriate for the situation. A way of communicating this might include. \\"I am not concerned about your job, I am concerned about you.\\"  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **DEMONSTRATE** as much concern for the members of the team as is demonstrated for the community, risk management, or management perception.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **MESSAGE** about mental health and wellbeing routinely and leverage the use of technology when appropriate. \\n\\n  \\n**PEERS** \\n\\nPeers have a unique opportunity to break through the skepticism and challenges with trust that some may have within policing. When a peer shares their personal experience with mental health struggles, substance use, or a suicide attempt, it can combat the challenge of silence that can exist around these issues. Peers sharing their experience empower individuals in the force who might be experiencing similar challenges. The voice and presence of a peer, of someone who has been there, can send a message of \\"This officer is not embarrassed about it. This officer has been there. I am not the only one going through this.\\" It enables an officer struggling to say, \\"I am going through the same thing.\\" Peers show that it is brave to be vulnerable, that one does not have to be paralyzed by perceptions of getting help, and it is okay to prioritize getting better. When a peer has struggles, they often become their own champion and this passion spreads to others in the agency or the group they are speaking to. The guidance for messaging related to peers' stories and communication about their own experience is to be applied to communication to groups of people. Peer supporters must be able to adjust their language to meet the needs of individuals they are supporting and share their message in a genuine and engaging manner. Peers need to share their message in a genuine and engaging manner. They must be able to tell the right story in a way the connects with others throughout they agency. These messages need to be delivered in a balanced way, avoiding making it all about one person's story or implying that what worked for one will work for all. Specific details of a suicide attempt or substance overdose should be given only if it is essential to relate to the group. It is impossible to measure the full impact of peers in communicating about suicide prevention and normalizing mental health challenges. \\n\\n  \\n**Tips for Peers**\\n\\n*   **SHARE** stories in a genuine, approachable, and vulnerable manner while connecting with the specific needs of the groups you are communicating with. Use caution to refrain from making stories seem all about one's personal experience.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **COMMUNICATE** in a safe manner and include graphic details only if it is necessary.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **FOCUS** on full spectrum of mental health challenges - by addressing the things that might seem less significant, one might prevent crises.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **EMPHASIZE** help-seeking, accessing treatment, and using a variety of resources including peer support.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **ADJUST** approach, message, and stories to the audience maintaining sensitivity to culture. One size does not fit all, and what a peer shares to the family support unit may be different with the S.W.A.T. team or a group of corrections officers working at a women's facility.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **CHANGE** the delivery of the message to fit the audience; however, the message of self-care, hope, resiliency, and recovery cannot change. \\n\\n  \\n**FAMILY**\\n\\nAgencies must remember the larger police network and that families and support persons play a key role in suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Agencies can create intentional messaging to families which will serve to increase family support and provide information to family members who may be one of the first to see warning signs of a suicidal crisis. Agencies can keep the following in mind to create suicide prevention messages to family members of police and to support positive family interactions throughout an officer's career. \\n\\nIt is important to emphasize that the law enforcement family member will have positive and satisfying times in their career. It is equally important to normalize times of challenge and mental health struggles. Agencies should inform families who to go to for assistance and resources if they become concerned about their family member so they can still be a competent and in control officer. Provide family members information about ways to help care for their officer's mental wellbeing, who they can reach out to if concerned about their officer, and what to look for regarding signs of concern across the spectrum of issues that may arise. In addition to written materials, it is helpful for families to receive communications about mental health promotion and suicide prevention during the academy, at family events, promotion and retirement gatherings, support groups, and any other means through which families are engaged in the agency. When developing messages about suicide prevention for families, agencies should consider that support persons may not call a phone number off a card on a refrigerator magnet if they have no other experience or information about that resource. Remember that the only information a family member may have is what the officer has shared with them. \\n\\nIt is a good practice for the professionals providing mental health support to be at the events where families are to help build trust, even if the event is not a mental health-focused event. Engage families in understanding the strength it takes to be an officer, the resilience that officers show on a daily basis, and the importance of being and active part of the support system. Messages need to communicate the culture of the agency about mental health, share accurate information, and refrain from alarming families. Agencies can ask family members to be active in caring for themselves and include information encouraging family members to get help for themselves when needed. \\n\\n  \\n**Tips for Families** \\n\\n*   **INCLUDE** all support systems that a law enforcement officer might identify as family, beyond blood relatives or married partners.  \\n      \\n    \\n*   **ASSIST** families in understanding they can support their officer while still respecting the officer's sense of independence and strength.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **FOCUS** on strength, resilience, positive messages in addition to messaging about signs and what to look for in a family member.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **COMMUNICATE** how to support police from a family perspective.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **SHARE** that suicide risk is a concern without over-emphasizing the concern or contributing to a heightened awareness from support persons.   \\n      \\n    \\n*   **GIVE** facts on how to respond, and who to go to.   \\n      \\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n  \\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIt is essential to talk openly about mental health an suicide prevention in departments, across all levels, and to do so in a way that connects to the unique needs of police officers and their families. Agencies should honor a member that has died by suicide while also respecting the needs of those who may be struggling. This can be done by following safe messaging guidelines. Sharing stories of healing and recovery empowers officers to seek help for themselves and to have each other's backs.

The primary function of worry is to anticipate future problems and then take steps to address these problems. If instead someone simply broods about the anticipated problem, thinking about it over and over, and feeling helpless, they are letting their helpful worry system turn into a liability. Some people continue to worry because it temporarily reduces their concerns. For example, some people have the sense that, _I won't forget this important task as long as I keep thinking of it every few minutes, or, If I keep thinking about work tomorrow I won't make important mistakes; if I stop thinking about it I may forget something important_. As a result, it can be hard for them to let go of their worrying behavior. At the same time, letting the same worries cycle through the mind every few minutes without taking action to solve the problem uses up mental capacity, taking away attention from other important tasks. Reducing needless worry makes more of your mental capacity available so that your attention and concentration can function effectively. Several useful procedures that can help to ensure that worrying is used effectively rather than becoming a liability are discussed next.", "title": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 18:13:14.613502+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 18:13:14.613502+00	\N	f

87acc793-f5bd-4131-9748-23cbdd99b934	LE - Substance Abuse - Principles of Successful Treatments	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Principles of Successful Treatments**\\n\\n\\nThere are a variety of different forms of treatment for substance use problems, and different approaches may be effective for different people. The following are general principles to keep in mind about effective substance abuse treatment programs.\\n\\n**Different people may require different treatments.**\\n\\nBecause people differ in many ways, some will respond more favorably to treatment A compared to treatment B, while others will do much better with Treatment B. The important point is that a poor response to the first treatment does not mean that other treatments don't work. Once the decision to break free of the grip of substance abuse, resolve to keep at it as long as it takes. If the first attempt is not adequately helpful, make plans right away to pursue the next treatment. It is helpful to research the average effectiveness of different treatments, and plan to try those that have been the most successful for the greatest number of people. But if that treatment doesn't work, resolve to move on to the next one, as many times as it takes to become healthy again.\\n\\n**Substance abuse can produce long-lasting changes in brain functioning.**\\n\\nThe brain of someone who has used pain medications for 6 months is changed from when they initially started taking the medications, such as after a surgery. Because of these long-lasting changes, the brain responds differently to cues like visual reminders of using the substance. For example, someone who became addicted to oxycontin during recovery from surgery may have successfully stopped using after going through treatment. However, opening a prescription pill bottle to take antibiotics for an infection may trigger strong memories of using oxycontin, and may lead to a strong craving for the drug, even though they have successfully stopped using it. This helps to explain why someone who may have successfully stopped using a substance years earlier continues to have a risk of strong cravings for the substance, which may lead to a relapse. Recognizing that substance abuse leads to long-lasting brain changes can promote vigilance and caution by the recovering substance user, so that they do not become complacent and assume they will never use a substance again once they have stopped. At the same time, it should also encourage self-compassion, so that if cravings and urges to use do appear one can recognize that this is due to changes in brain functioning, and not a sign of weakness or moral failure.\\n\\n**Taking care of more than just the substance use.**\\n\\nAlthough the focus of substance use treatment is primarily the substance use itself, it is important to address other issues that may be making life more difficult and interfering with successful substance use treatment. For example, someone who has struggled with significant anxiety may begin using Xanax or Valium occasionally for sleep problems, and then become more and more reliant on these drugs to manage their anxiety. Stopping the use of these medications without also addressing the anxiety will be less likely to succeed than if a plan for reducing anxiety is also put into place. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) offers many effective tools for reducing anxiety, as well as other psychological or behavioral problems that may interfere with successfully getting free of substance use problems.\\n\\n**Take the time needed to be successful.**\\n\\nIt can be tempting to want to end substance use treatment after achieving some success. For example, someone may stop using alcohol completely for a week, and then decide that they can stop treatment because they are done. However, the changes in brain functioning that occur during periods of alcohol abuse will persist for much longer than a week, and the alcohol-related habits and associations will take significantly longer to address. Someone who quits treatment prematurely is at significant risk for relapse soon after quitting treatment. Knowing this, it is important to commit to devoting as much time as needed to gain long-term control over your habits, so that alcohol or other substances are no longer in control. Treatment duration varies depending on the type of substance and the length of time of excessive use; however, it is reasonable to plan for 3 months of treatment, whether as inpatient, outpatient, or a combination of the two. There is reasonable evidence that longer treatment duration is linked to more successful outcome. At the same time, it is widely recognized that relapse is not rare after treatment; if this occurs, returning for additional treatment should be a top priority, so that you can minimize any harmful effects of the relapse.\\n\\n**Medications can be a valuable part of treatment.**\\n\\nDepending on the type of problem substance (alcohol, opiates, stimulants, etc.), medication may be very helpful. Naltrexone and disulfiram (Antabuse) have been approved for treating alcohol dependence. Naltrexone works by blocking the pathways in the brain that lead to the initial pleasurable effects of alcohol. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is intended to be taken as a barrier against using alcohol by interfering with the normal metabolism of alcohol. If alcohol is ingested after taking Antabuse, the person will begin within minutes to experience symptoms similar to a moderate to severe hangover, such as nausea, vomiting, and headache. This makes Antabuse a strong deterrent against using alcohol.\\n\\nFor opioid dependence (e.g., oxycontin, vicodin, or heroin), medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone help to control withdrawal symptoms and craving, and to reduce the pleasurable effects of opioid abuse. These medications can help reduce cravings for the problem substance, so that staying free of the problem substance is easier to accomplish.\\n\\n**Monitoring drug use during treatment is important.**\\n\\nBecause relapse is common during the course of treatment, having someone monitor possible drug use during treatment provides increased incentive for the person to abstain from using, especially when urges to use are strong. Regular monitoring also provides rapid feedback that current treatment may need to be adjusted to better meet the needs of the person being treated. Quickly adjusting treatment in response to indications that the person is using again improves treatment effectiveness and increases the opportunity for success.", "title": "Principles of Successful Treatments", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 19:50:57.235022+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:12:49.236374+00	\N	f

Try to be complete in listing your worries, and if more worry thoughts show up after your first pass, add them to the list of worries. You can then run each worry through the simple but effective cognitive techniques explained below. \\n\\nExamine the Evidence\\n\\nFor each worry, write down in one column any evidence that the worried outcome is likely to happen. For example, if your worry thought is, \\"I'm going to lose my job,\\" write down all of the reasonable evidence you come up with that this is true that you really are going to lose your job (for example, \\"I made a mistake a work last week\\"). Next, in a separate column, write down all the evidence that this worry is not true (for example, \\"My supervisor gave positive feedback on my performance yesterday\\"). After putting down all of the evidence you can think of, assign an estimated weight to the evidence for and the evidence against this worry, and see which viewpoint outweighs the other. For example, if you list only two items as evidence that you are going to lose your job, but list ten items that you are not going to lose your job, the weight of evidence would be much stronger against your worry. Examining the evidence for each worry can give you a more accurate and realistic perspective, and in some cases the persistent worry will naturally fade away as a result. If examining the evidence is not sufficient, try the Downward Arrow technique.\\n\\nDownward Arrow\\n\\nFor each worry that you listed that is still causing you concern, ask yourself, \\"If this were true, what would be so bad about it? What would it mean?\\" Write down your answer to that question, and then pose the same question to that answer, and to the next answer, until you eventually reach the most basic concern.\\n\\nFor example, if the worrying thought is, \\"I'm going to make a mistake that causes me to lose my job,\\" you would ask yourself, \\"If this were true, what would be so bad, and what would it mean?\\" Your response might be, \\"If I make a mistake on duty, everyone at work will know about it.\\" The downward arrow technique would look something like this:\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/arrow_technique2.png)  \\n\\nOnce you have explicitly written out the levels of concerns that are behind your recurring worries, you can then consider how realistic these concerns are. If you are unsure, you can examine the evidence for and against each level of the worrying thought. However, for many, simply writing out on paper the underlying concern allows them to see that their concerns are unlikely to occur. This can help reduce the frequency and intensity of the worry. But a third technique is available as well.\\n\\nList Solutions and Ways of Coping\\n\\nSometimes our worries are unfounded, but sometimes they are at least partly true. For example, the worry, \\"I won't be able to pay my bills this month\\" would be realistic for someone who has been spending too much. Obviously, simply worrying about this won't help. Instead, writing down a realistic plan to reduce spending and to save enough money to pay bills can both take care of your financial problem, and also allow you to stop worrying. If your realistic, written plan for your finances shows that you will still come up short at the end of the month, you can then write down several possible solutions to this problem, such as a) take on extra work, b) ask for a temporary loan, c) sell some used items that are no longer needed.\\n\\nWorrying persists when we don't have a clear solution to the problem. By taking just a few minutes to clearly write out the nature of the worry, and listing some concrete solutions to the problem, you can free up your mental space for more productive activities.\\n\\nMake Checklists of Helpful Actions\\n\\nIf the things you are worrying about can be addressed through taking some action, make a checklist of the actions and then check off each item when you have completed it. For example, if you are worried about your health, actions you could take would include getting a medical checkup, buying a blood pressure instrument that you can use at home, and starting an exercise routine. You can write these tasks out on a checklist, and then check each off once you have made a doctor's appointment, ordered a blood pressure cuff, and decided on an exercise routine and scheduled a start date. Taking these actions allow you to get these recurrent worrying thoughts out of your head, freeing up mental capacity to allow you to think more clearly and work more effectively.", "title": "Cognitive Strategies to Manage Worry", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 18:15:57.320152+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 18:15:57.320152+00	\N	f

Think of our pre-historic ancestors, who may have barely escaped starvation during a long winter. During the following Spring, Summer, and Fall, their minds would likely go back again and again to the possibility of starving during the next Winter. Their ability to worry about the future serves two important functions: it identifies an important future threat (possible starvation), and energizes and motivates them to take action to prevent the threat. After all, it's not enough to simply recognize that you might starve in the future if you don't also experience motivation to do something about it.\\n\\nOur prehistoric ancestors did not likely enjoy worrying, and in fact probably found it unpleasant to think about the possibility of future starvation. But because the worrying prompted efforts to gather, preserve, store, and safeguard food for the winter, it served an adaptive purpose in keeping our ancestors alive. Other humans alive at the same time who lacked the predisposition to worry often would not have survived to pass along their more carefree traits to later generations. \\n\\nAnd so our ability to worry has been passed down from ancestors who survived in part because they were able to worry, and for the most part this ability is helpful. However, some people develop a pattern of worrying excessively, so that they worry about events they cannot control, or continue to worry about a task they have already completed. When worrying becomes excessive and persistent, it can interfere with sleeping adequately, because the worrying causes arousal in the nervous system, which delays sleep onset. Excessive worrying can also interfere with attention and concentration, because the worry thoughts tap into some of the limited cognitive resources that we rely upon to remain focused and present in the moment. Worry thoughts can also lead to poorer sleep, poorer job performance, and then even more worry as concerns about mistakes at work or being unable to sleep become more prominent. In this manner, the worry process can become a vicious cycle, causing distress and interfering with effectiveness, which in turn leads to more worry.", "title": "Anxiety and Worry", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 18:12:03.58321+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 18:12:03.58321+00	\N	f

This includes:\\n\\n*   Stabilizing emotionally overwhelmed survivor\\n*   Orienting emotionally overwhelmed survivors\\n*   The role of medications in stabilization\\n\\nAlthough disasters can be highly distressing, most people will not require stabilization. Stabilization may be necessary for those who are emotionally overwhelmed. Look for signs such as unresponsiveness to questions or directions; showing disorganized, aimless behaviors; persistent shaking or trembling; looking glassy-eyed; or frantic behaviors. \\n\\nStabilization measures include respecting the person's privacy and offering time to recover before intervening; standing nearby while providing services to others, so the distressed person may seek you at his or her preference. You can also simply remain quiet and available instead of speaking directly to the person, giving time for the person to recover. If the person is willing to interact, you may suggest that he or she select specific distressing feelings or thoughts that they may be able to address and bring under control. If friends or family are available, ask for their involvement in reducing distress, if appropriate. It can also be reassuring to simply explain to the person how agency efforts are organized, what is available, what will happen next, and what choices he or she may be able to make. If the distressed person is receptive, suggest that they try a calming exercise that can help them to reduce their distress. This can include a muscle relaxation exercise or deep breathing practice. This can include demonstrating for them the act of taking a deep breath, holding briefly, then releasing slowly, and repeating several times. For intensely distressed persons, it can be useful to gently ask the person to look directly at you and to listen as you calmly ask if he or she can state where they are, and to describe the physical environment. You can also ask the person to ask if he or she understands what is happening. This can help to interrupt the sense of panic and alarm, and help to orient the person to the present moment. \\n\\nThe National Center for PTSD provides the following script for a grounding exercise. \\"Grounding can help you feel less overwhelmed. It works by turning your attention from your thoughts back to the outside world. Here's what you do: Sit in a comfortable position with your legs and arms uncrossed.

This includes several well-established techniques:\\n\\n**Avoid Caffeine After Mid-Afternoon**\\n\\nIt takes your body several hours to metabolize caffeine, and so coffee and other caffeinated drinks in the late afternoon can result in caffeine molecules coursing through your bloodstream even after you go to bed, interfering with the natural biological process that leads to sleep. If you tend to use caffeinated drinks in the evening, try substituting a non-caffeinated alternative.\\n\\n**Maintain Stable Times for Going to Bed and Getting Up Each Day**\\n\\nAfter a long week it can be tempting to stay out late Friday or Saturday night, and sleep in the next morning. However, irregular sleep schedules are associated with greater sleep disturbances, such as insomnia. Going to bed at or near the same time each night, and waking at or near the same time each morning, allows one's natural circadian rhythms to become well-entrenched, so that sleep onset occurs more quickly upon going to bed, making it easier to wake at the same time each morning.\\n\\n**Follow a Sleep Schedule and Establish a Bedtime Routine**\\n\\nIn addition to going to bed at the same time each night, [following a sleep schedule](https://www.sleep.org/articles/get-sleep-schedule/) and establishing a pre-bedtime routine can allow one's body to develop an anticipatory response that promotes the onset of sleep more readily. An example sequence could include laying out tomorrow's clothes, setting up the coffee maker for the morning, practicing a brief meditation or relaxation exercise, brushing teeth, then going to bed. Because this habitual routine leads to sleep, the brain will more efficiently begin to signal the neurochemical cascades that transition us from wakefulness to sleep. As part of this routine, discontinue stimulating activities (such as TV, video games, or social media) about an hour before bedtime. Bright light (particularly blue-spectrum light such as from TV, smartphone, or tablet screens) can suppress the production of melatonin, the hormone that triggers the onset of sleep.\\n\\n**Reserve the Bed (Almost) Exclusively for Sleep**\\n\\nWatching TV, talking on the phone, checking social media, or reading books, are also stimulating and wakefulness-related activities. If we do these while in bed, our brain associates the bed with wakefulness and with these stimulating activities. This can interfere with sleep onset. Sleep quality can be enhanced by moving to a chair or another room while engaging in these activities, and getting into bed only when prepared for sleep. For those who have difficulty falling asleep after getting into bed, it can be helpful to get out of bed, doing something quiet and non-stimulating, waiting until feeling sleepy again, and then returning to bed. This may take a few nights, but soon the bed will be associated with being asleep rather than the frustration of being unable to fall asleep.\\n\\n**Use Relaxation Techniques to Lower Arousal**\\n\\nThere are several varieties of techniques that help to reduce arousal, facilitating the onset of sleep. These techniques are particularly helpful during times of increased stress, and for those naturally prone to anxiety or worry. There are many free online guided relaxation or meditation exercises, and some of these take only 5-15 minutes. These exercises are quite effective for inducing relaxation for most people, and cause no side effects. There is no clear advantage of one type of relaxation technique over another, and so experimenting with different available options can allow you to select the one that works best for you in promoting sleep.\\n\\n**Engage in Physical Exercise at the Right Time**\\n\\nPhysical exercise promotes relaxation as well as improved sleep quality. However, be sure to plan your exercise routine so that you finish working out at least 2-3 hours before bedtime. By doing so, you will allow time for exercise-induced physiological arousal to return to normal prior to sleep.", "title": "Sleep Hygiene", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 20:46:09.216994+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:05:30.139132+00	\N	f

Of course, we believe that seeking expert guidance in coping with difficult problems is an indication of strength and wise decision-making. At the same time, for some people it is so aversive to have others know that they are seeking a therapist that they would simply not attend. Teletherapy is an excellent option for such a person, as it allows for maximum privacy.\\n\\n**Accessibility**\\n\\nTeletherapy expands the accessibility of therapists who might otherwise not be able to meet with clients because of scheduling or distance issues.\\n\\n**Additional Considerations**\\n\\nTeletherapy has some limitations when compared to in-person meetings with a therapist. Some conditions (such as severe depression) require in-person treatment. Additionally, technology problems can disrupt the delivery of teletherapy services (such as a lack of internet connection).

Fear gives us instant strength and energy to cope with an immediate threat, and anxiety and worry allow us to anticipate future threats, and motivate us to take action to prevent them. Panic attacks occur when the fear circuit experiences a false alarm, and while they do not cause any medical harm, they can be very distracting. Recognizing a panic attack as a false alarm, and reminding yourself to simply observe the sensations and emotions as they pass, can help to make the experience of a panic attack less distracting. In addition, practicing belly breathing can help to prevent or more effectively cope with panic attacks if they occur. When persistent worries become distracting or distressing, writing down each worry and using cognitive techniques can provide a more realistic perspective on the likelihood of a feared event occurring, as well as identifying and planning ways to prevent or deal with the event if it does occur. Learning to manage anxiety and worry can help them from interfering with your performance at work, and with your enjoyment of time away from work.", "title": "Summary", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 18:22:27.923359+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 18:22:47.847198+00	\N	f

Even though the content may not be appropriate for everyone, humor is very common among those who deal with disturbing scenes in the line of duty. It appears that this use of humor protects first responders by providing psychological \\"distancing\\" from the situation. It can feel emotionally overwhelming to empathize with victims of disturbing crimes or accidents. Researchers suggest that the use of humor allows first responders to \\"re-frame\\" the situation in a way that shifts the painful human suffering into the background. Rather than making the first responder \\"cold\\" or \\"unfeeling,\\" it allows the first responder to focus their attention on the task at hand, and keeps them from being distracted by the natural feelings of distress in seeing another person's suffering. You may already have found yourself using humor in this way, and it may be a relief to recognize that this does not mean that there is anything wrong with you, or anything inappropriate with coping this way.  Research has shown that humor is used frequently among those whose work includes sexual exploitation of children. By using humor to gain some psychological distance, you are likely making yourself more effective by keeping your mind clearer. In addition, you are keeping yourself healthier both physically and mentally by reducing physiological and psychological effects of the work. This will help make you more resilient in this line of work, and less vulnerable to burnout. In fact, in one sample of firefighters, PTSD symptoms were higher in those that rarely used humor to cope, whereas those who frequently coped by using humor had much lower rates of PTSD symptoms. Because these studies were correlational, we cannot know for sure whether using humor actually reduced secondary stress, or if those with more secondary stress were just less likely to use humor. However, it is reasonable to allow yourself to use lighthearted humor as a way of coping with exposure to ICAC-related distress.", "title": "Coping Strategy: Using Humor to Cope", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:44:06.826117+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:05:57.69733+00	\N	f

When performing shift work, it is important that first responders take extra care to optimize their sleep, and they may achieve this through a number of strategies, including:\\n\\n*   Avoiding alcohol, which tends to interfere with the sleep cycle and can thus interfere with the ability to transition between sleeping during days and nights. Utilizing blackout curtains, a sleep mask, and a noise-cancelling device to help minimize the impact of factors that can disrupt sleep during daylight hours. Dark conditions promote the production of Melatonin, a hormone that plays an important role in sleep, whereas exposure to light prior to bedtime tends to inhibit the production of Melatonin.\\n*   Investigating Melatonin treatment. Some research has shown that for night shift workers, Melatonin may increase both daytime and nighttime sleep duration. You can learn more about Melatonin by clicking [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-melatonin/art-20363071). Too large a dose of Melatonin can disrupt your sleep cycle, and the National Sleep Foundation has recommended starting with two-tenths of a milligram, and then increasing the dose as needed, up to 5-milligrams. Also, be careful to only use Melatonin from a trusted source, as many supplements on the market are of questionable quality. Avoiding any unnecessary interruptions to your sleep, whenever possible and practical. For example, you should consider making arrangements to minimize the chance that phone calls, meetings, appointments, deliveries, and other interruptions will disrupt your critically important sleep time.\\n*   Maintaining as close to a regular sleep-wake cycle as feasible, which is particularly important since your body is already adapting to a non-standard sleep schedule.\\n*   Limiting the use of caffeine prior to your bedtime. Research has demonstrated that the use of caffeine even six hours prior to bedtime causes a significant reduction in sleep length, even though people may often not accurately perceive how much caffeine is interfering with their sleep.\\n*   Enlisting the support of your spouse, significant other, children, and anyone else who lives with you or can be of assistance ensuring that you get plenty of uninterrupted sleep time.", "title": "Shift Work Sleep Optimization", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 20:49:31.234316+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:05:44.533763+00	\N	f

As a result, children who grow up in such environments often carry out these same sorts of behaviors when they become adults—there is an increased likelihood of being physically aggressive towards partners and children, and an increased likelihood of having a partner who is physically aggressive. Separately from physical aggression, a history of adverse childhood events increases the likelihood of relationship distress and conflict, which may lead to ending the relationship through divorce or separation. \\n\\nThere are at least two likely reasons for relationship problems: First, children growing up in dysfunctional environments observe dysfunctional relationship behaviors, such as expressing contempt, excessive criticism, or making degrading comments towards others. Observing these behaviors produces a sort of template or guide for how people act towards each other. \\n\\nSecond, there is an absence of role modeling or instruction on how to communicate and interact effectively. In other words, kids who grow up in such environments do not have someone showing them how to be an effective relationship partner or parent. Through no fault of their own, they end up in adulthood without effective relationship skills needed to be successful in marriage or dating relationships, or as a parent. Imagine growing up without going to school and with no one teaching you to read, and then being asked suddenly as an adult to read through a complicated textbook. Without receiving instructions or modeling appropriate behaviors, we can similarly find ourselves bewildered in trying to make relationships work. Developing successful relationships with partners and children can be a challenge even for people who grew up in nurturing, loving environments; for those who grew up in situations involving abuse, neglect, or other adverse events, the challenge is even greater. However, effective relationship skills can be learned at any point in life, and the Cordico Wellness app includes modules on relationships (Making Marriage Work), as well as parenting (Parenting Tips) that describe scientifically supported strategies to develop skills to improve these relationships.", "title": "Effects on Relationships ", "summary": "Growing up in an environment in which verbal abuse or physical aggression was frequent provides a sort of model for how people behave.

Preparing financially for retirement includes making sure that your retirement income and assets will be sufficient to pay your bills and cover the cost of purchases and activities you have been planning, as well as a reasonable financial cushion for unexpected costs.\\n\\nAs you approach retirement it is important to make sure that you will be able to afford regular expenses, as well as any special expenses you might have planned for retirement. Take some time to add up how much you have in your savings and any retirement or other investment accounts you have set up. Depending on your department, you may have a pension or other form of defined benefit that lists how much money you will receive each month, whether it will increase across time and by how much. Also take a look at any benefits associated with your retirement, such as continued healthcare coverage, or subsidized health insurance.\\n\\nNext, take a look at your current expenses, and make a list of how these expenses are likely to change in retirement. For example, if a mortgage payment is a large part of your monthly expenses, but you will be paying off your mortgage completely two years after retirement, this will free up a good amount of money for other uses. On the other hand, if you plan to buy a vacation home when you retire, your monthly expenses would likely increase. Many people find that some expenses decrease in retirement (because they tend to spend less on paycheck deductions, gasoline, dining out, and other work-related expenses), but your own experience may vary. If you plan to spend time with family and friends, working in the yard and relaxing at home, your costs should be low. But if you are planning to travel around the world, buy an expensive car, or take on a large renovation of your house, expenses could go up. Information on average monthly expenses in retirement is available here ([Retirement Expenses](https://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2016/01/25/heres-what-the-average-retired-americans-budget-lo.aspx)) and here ([Retirement Budget calculator](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/ret01?skn=606&r=1)). Estimate the likely costs of activities and purchases you are planning for retirement, and build these in to your expected retirement budget. Also estimate how frequently these expenses will occur. A month at the beach every 5 years will cost much less than three months at the beach every winter. Estimating in advance how much these activities will cost allows you to make informed decisions about how you want to spend your money in retirement without being disappointed at having to give up making a purchase you were looking forward to; or worse, finding yourself running out of retirement funds prematurely. Additional online tools are available to help you estimate your retirement expenses and to evaluate whether you are saving enough to meet these expenses ([AARP Retirement Calculator](https://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/retirement_calculator.html); [Retirement Estimator](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/09/the-simple-way-to-find-your-retirement-number.aspx); [Retirement Savings Calculator](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/retirement-calculator?skn=606&r=1)).", "title": "Preparing Financially", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 21:25:36.809734+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:02:06.761496+00	\N	f

Some physicians have noted that male public safety professionals appear to experience a drop in natural testosterone levels after they retire. This may be a consequence of the biological roller coaster that a public safety career involves, with testosterone production dropping at retirement when the biological roller coaster ride ends.\\n\\nWhatever the reason, lowered testosterone levels can lead to significant changes in physical and psychological functioning. Physically, low testosterone has been associated with increased rates of sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Psychologically, men with low testosterone have more than twice the risk of depression compared to men with normal testosterone levels.\\n\\nIf you notice depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, low energy, or reduced sex drive, it is possible that low testosterone is involved. If these problems have been bothering you for a prolonged period, consider scheduling an appointment to have your testosterone levels checked. If your doctor concludes that you have low testosterone, you may be prescribed some form of testosterone replacement therapy, such as a patch, a gel, or periodic injections. A systematic review of studies found a significant reduction in depressive symptoms in men following testosterone replacement therapy, and other studies have reported additional health benefits including increased energy, decreased body fat, and improved sexual performance.\\n\\nFactors other than testosterone also contribute to depression, and if you are depressed it is important to consider other factors. However, having your testosterone levels checked is a relatively easy way to find out whether low testosterone may play a role in any depressive symptoms you may be experiencing.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**\\\\*Please Note:** Testosterone therapy also carries various risks. For example, according to the Mayo Clinic, these risks can include:\\n\\n*   Worsening sleep apnea — a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. \\n*   Causing acne or other skin reactions. \\n*   Stimulating noncancerous growth of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and growth of existing prostate cancer. \\n*   Enlarging breasts. \\n*   Limiting sperm production or causing testicles to shrink. \\n*   Stimulating too much red blood cell production, which contributes to the increased risk of forming a blood clot. A clot could break loose, travel through your bloodstream and lodge in your lungs, blocking blood flow (pulmonary embolism).\\n\\nAlso, some research shows that testosterone therapy can increase your risk of heart disease. More research is needed. \\n\\nIt is important to consult your doctor regarding the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy before beginning any treatment. \\n\\n(**Source:** [Testosterone therapy: Potential benefits and risks as you age](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728))", "title": "Testosterone and Depression", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 21:30:33.725008+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:02:27.348604+00	\N	f

Researcher Dan Buettner referred to these areas as \\"Blue Zones\\", and has studied their characteristics extensively. Although each region has its own particular diet and unique characteristics, they all shared some features in common: continued social engagement; steady, moderate physical activity; a primarily plant-based diet; a strong emphasis on family; modest alcohol consumption; and, absence of smoking. In comparison with the rest of the world, residents of these regions experience far lower rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia, and enjoy significantly more years of robust physical health and psychological well-being. Although some degree of their longevity is likely due to good genetics, the fact that these exceptionally healthy communities from all parts of the world follow similar lifestyle patterns suggests that they could be a very good model to follow.\\n\\n**Social Engagement**\\n\\nRetirement means that you will have more time to spend with friends and family, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they will have more time to spend with you. At the same time, the daily social interactions with colleagues and the public that comes with your work is suddenly removed. Interacting regularly with other people is vitally important for happiness, well-being, and a sense of connection and community. Preparing for retirement should include some thoughtful consideration for how you will tend your current relationships, and perhaps how you might develop new social relationships.\\n\\n**Work Relationships**\\n\\nAfter retirement it is very normal to have no one from the Department contact you. Some retirees may feel cut off or rejected by their colleagues; however, if you view this absence of contact as simply part of the normal sequence of work life, you don't need to have any negative feelings about it. For colleagues who became close friends, it may be up to you to reach out and make plans to maintain the relationship, keeping in mind that your co-workers who have not yet retired will have less free time and less flexibility than you do in retirement. At the same time, scheduling regular time to spend with close friends from work can help you to maintain and deepen long-standing connections. Because the nature of your relationship will change as you transition away from being a work colleague, it can be helpful to allow yourself flexibility in accepting changes in how you and your former co-workers relate to one another.\\n\\n**Couples Relationships**\\n\\nRetirement involves major changes in daily routine, and sometimes couples find themselves having difficulty adjusting to being around each other. It can be helpful to schedule time away from each other, such as each person going out separately with their own friends. However, the relationship can also deepen and grow in retirement. Planning activities that you and your partner both enjoy, or that involve a shared value, may deepen your appreciation for one another, and strengthen your relationship through shared experiences.\\n\\nAt the same time, if there is a significant increase in conflict with your partner, or if you begin to wonder if you can live together under the same roof, seeing a couple's counselor can be extremely helpful. Just a few sessions with a marital counselor can provide you with effective communication and problem-solving skills that can help avoid recurring relationship conflicts. It is worth the time and effort you may put in to building and maintaining a close, harmonious relationship with your spouse or partner, because research has shown that those who remain married or in a committed relationship in retirement are significantly healthier, happier, and satisfied on average. And married men live longer on average than their single counterparts.\\n\\n**Family and Friends**\\n\\nRetirement can provide an opportunity to maintain and deepen relationships with other family members and friends from outside of work. However, it is important to recognize that closer relationships mostly likely will not just happen naturally. Instead, you will likely need to look for ways to spend time together in task and activities that let you interact and enjoy shared experiences.\\n\\nThis can include planning a camping trip with friends, or with your grown children or grandchildren (as long as everyone involved enjoys camping). This could also include asking family members to join with you in a new regular event, such as weekly Sunday dinners, or volunteering together at an animal shelter or nursing home, or taking grandkids on a weekly or monthly trip to the movies.\\n\\nYou can more effectively deepen and strengthen your relationships by sharing activities that allow you to communicate, such as going for walks together, or playing cards, or working in the yard together. In addition to planning fun shared activities, spending time with a family member on activities you both value, such as volunteering to help clean up a local park, or tutoring at a neighborhood school, stores up memories of shared experiences that will further bond your relationship. \\n\\n**Moderating Alcohol Use**\\n\\nRetirement means more time on your hands, and it can be tempting to drink more frequently, and to start earlier in the day. This can lead to problematic drinking, as it becomes easier to have just one more drink. Guidelines for alcohol consumption recommend no more than two alcoholic drinks in a day for men, and no more than one a day for women. If you find yourself frequently drinking more than these recommended amounts, consider changes that you can make to your daily activities that would allow you to avoid or delay alcohol. This can include noticing when and where you typically have your first drink (for example, in the living room at home at 5:00 PM), and then planning to be somewhere that you would not have an opportunity to drink during that time period. By changing your routine and planning enjoyable activities that don't prompt you to drink, you can cut down on or eliminate alcohol, and keep it from interfering with your health. If you believe you may have difficulty in cutting back on alcohol, talk with your doctor or with a mental health professional about ways to control your drinking.\\n\\n**Regular Exercise**\\n\\nThe most important behavior you can engage in for great physical health is regular exercise. To make exercise a regular part of your day, it can be helpful to partner up with someone for a daily brisk walk, swim, exercise class, or bike ride. It also helps to make sure the exercise is something you will enjoy. And if you grow bored with one form of exercise, consider switching to another workout to keep yourself motivated and engaged.\\n\\nIn addition to improving physical health, cardiovascular exercise has been demonstrated to reduce or even reverse the cognitive decline that often accompanies aging. Studies have demonstrated that sedentary volunteers who were randomly assigned to exercise a few times a week have significantly better performance on tasks of memory, attention, and concentration, compared to a control group that did not start exercising. Differences even showed up on brain imaging studies, where the group randomly assigned to exercise had a larger average brain volume compared to the group that remained sedentary. The brain volume difference was especially pronounced in the hippocampus, which is critical for forming new memories. And so, by taking charge of staying physically fit by exercising regularly, you will also be keeping your brain and memory functioning at their best.", "title": "Healthy Living: Social Connections, Alcohol Use and Exercise", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 21:31:25.517921+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:02:32.312351+00	\N	f

Identifying what matters the most to you can help you decide how best to spend your time. Some values that are important to many people are described below.\\n\\n*   **Protecting and nurturing** is one core value, and for some this includes taking care of their family, teaching their children or grandchildren right from wrong, and helping them to learn important skills.  \\n    \\n*   **Helping others** is often a core value among first responders, and may involve performing volunteer work during retirement.  \\n    \\n*   **Growing and learning** as a core value involves practicing new skills, reading, travel, or exploring new topics you may never have had time for during your career.\\n*   **If** **health and fitness** has been a core value, retirement will allow you more time to engage in different forms of exercise, and to shop for (or grow) and prepare the kinds of food that will help you stay fit and healthy for years to come.  \\n    \\n*   **Mentoring** combines helping others with a love of growth and learning. The wisdom and knowledge you have acquired through a full career as a first responder gives you an opportunity to foster growth in others.  \\n    \\n*   **Connecting** as a core value involves strengthening and deepening relationships with others. Retirement will allow more time to devote to relationships.  \\n    \\n*   **Enjoyment and appreciation** includes taking in pleasant experiences, savoring good food, viewing beautiful sites, enjoying interesting movies, and engaging in challenging sports.  \\n    \\n\\nConsider spending a few minutes identifying the core values that are most important to you. Next, think about ways that you could pursue these values during retirement. For example, if **Helping Others** and **Growing and Learning** are at the top of your list, consider training as a reading or math tutor, and then volunteering in your neighborhood school to help children who are struggling with math or reading. This can be very fulfilling and rewarding in its own right, but it can also make a significant impact in the lives of children who then learn to read effectively. This is very important, because kids are four times more likely to fail to graduate from high school on time if they cannot read at grade level by the end of third grade. And those who drop out of high school have a 63-fold increased risk of being incarcerated compared with high school graduates.\\n\\nA career first responder can continue to serve the community by keeping our children on the right path, and helping them to stay out of trouble in the future (e.g., by volunteering as a reading tutor in retirement). But retired first responders deserve to enjoy themselves as well, and this is a great time to pursue enjoyable and interesting activities you haven’t had time for. If **Enjoyment and Appreciation** are important to you, list some of the activities you have wanted to return to or try for the first time. This could include taking a cooking class, learning to golf, starting up camping again, or catching up on movies or books you didn’t have time for while working. Select one or more that are within your financial means and time constraints, and get a date down on your calendar to start. Especially if the activity takes a little background preparation, like getting certified to scuba dive or saving up for a trip, it can be easy to put off indefinitely. If you pin down a start date and location, this can get you moving in the right direction to ensure that you are spending your retirement time in meaningful, satisfying, and valued activities.", "title": "Valued Activities", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 21:29:37.102021+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:02:21.879094+00	\N	f

Have you become angry more frequently in certain situations, such as when you are under more stress or facing a deadline? When running late? Or in different locations, such as in a crowded restaurant or noisy meeting room? Or with certain people, either a specific co-worker or family member, or someone in a specific role, such as a supervisor, or employee in training? As you think about these events, try to notice when you started to become clearly angry. Did someone make a careless mistake, or say something that you took as a criticism? \\n\\n**Key Point:** Triggers are stimuli that precede an anger response. Common anger triggers include being treated with disrespect, feeling a lack of control, witnessing injustice, being lied to, witnessing someone you care for being mistreated, perceiving that you have been wronged, or having your physical safety violated. \\n\\nFor some, a noisy environment can set them on edge, so that they become irritated and then angry more quickly. Others are very sensitive to perceived criticism or being looked down on, and may escalate into anger rapidly if they perceive that someone has disrespected or belittled them. \\n\\nOnce you identify the triggers that are often followed by becoming angry, you may be able to modify your routine to avoid or reduce such triggers. This may include trying to avoid being in crowded, noisy environments when it is important to keep calm.

Moral injury may also result from betrayal by a trusted leader. In this module, we will review some of the situations in which this can occur, and the harmful effects that moral injury can produce.

For example, if Gary sees that his wife has not arrived home at 6 PM as she planned, and it is now 7 PM, he could experience a number of different emotions. If he thinks, “She may have been in an accident,” he would feel worried. If he instead thinks, “She probably went out with her friends for drinks and didn’t have the courtesy to call me,” he would feel frustrated or angry; and if he thinks, “She stayed late at work because she really cares about supporting our family,” he would feel grateful or proud of her. Although the situation in each example is the same – not arriving home on time – the emotional responses are very different because the attributions about the event are different. We make attributions automatically many times each day. However, we often fail to realize that the attribution we make is only one of many possible attributions, and that it may not be at all accurate. Negative attributions may occur so readily that more positive attributions do not emerge: “He doesn’t want to go out to dinner because he’s selfish” (instead of because he is tired); “She is spending too much money on family vacations because she is irresponsible” (rather than attributing her actions to wanting to create cherished family memories for their children). A pattern of negative attributions about one’s partner’s behaviors can result in an unrealistically negative view of the partner, and can erode the harmony and support that most people seek in relationships.\\n\\n**Quick Tip:** Simply recognizing that attributions are made all the time can allow us to step back, notice the attribution we are making, and then consider alternative, more benign attributions. If you find yourself getting angry or hurt by something your partner said, pause and reflect about what attribution you may have made. Ask yourself, “What is another way of looking at the situation?” You may find that several possible neutral or positive attributions may come to mind, and this can help to defuse the more negative, automatic response that led to anger or hurt. Fortunately, there are a number of effective strategies that can be used to improve and enhance your relationship.", "title": "Attributions", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 22:06:48.558884+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:58:26.255478+00	\N	f

It also triggers a defensive response in Rochelle: “I am not inconsiderate! Don’t you remember those times that I \\\\[insert counterexample of your choice\\\\]?” Gary’s statement set in motion a cascade of relationship-harming thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and created a set of negative emotions about each other and the relationship that, if repeated, could harm the relationships. \\n\\nWhat if Gary had instead said, “When you are late in picking me up for a scheduled event, I feel frustrated.” This sentence expresses accurately and concisely Gary’s emotional reaction, but does so in a way that does not attack Rochelle’s character or thoughtfulness, or otherwise attempt to insult or denigrate her. Instead, this statement focuses on a specific behavior – being late – rather than Rochelle as a person. Such a statement does not provoke defensiveness, because the statement is about only a specific behavior in a specific situation. Further, the statement does not imply rightness or wrongness – Gary simply states the emotion he was feeling – frustration in response to the behavior. Rochelle can disagree about whether she herself would feel frustrated in a similar situation, but she cannot really disagree with Gary’s statement that he felt a particular emotion.", "title": "Communication Strategies Part II: A Formula for Communicating", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 22:09:16.215935+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:58:35.380754+00	\N	f

Intentionally set times to interact with them, listen attentively, and share enjoyable experiences. Provide them with support, and seek support from them when you need it. \\n\\n**Step 3: Consider How You Interpret Events**\\n\\nNotice the ways that you think about and interpret events, including setbacks. Do you tend to blame yourself? Do you tend to make pessimistic attributions? (\\"I'll never be able to accomplish this\\"; \\"I might as well give up on trying for that promotion\\"). If so, try to write down these kinds of thoughts, and examine the evidence for and against them. See if you can generate one or two more optimistic statements that are realistic but positive. Practice these new thoughts, and observe to see if they enhance your motivation to persist and keep working at important goals.\\n\\n**Step 4: Be Proactive**\\n\\nIn difficult circumstances, try to act decisively on manageable steps toward valued goals, rather than being stalled by indecisiveness or avoidance. There is a natural tendency to become passive following a setback or loss; you may need to actually remind and instruct yourself to resume taking productive actions in such circumstances.\\n\\n**Step 5: Learn from Setbacks** \\n\\nWhen you encounter setbacks, allow yourself the opportunity to learn from the experience. Ask yourself questions such as, \\"What insights can I take away from this experience?\\" and \\"What about this experience will make me stronger or more knowledgeable in the future?\\" Setbacks often allow us a unique opportunity to learn valuable insights about ourselves and others, deepen our understanding of challenges, expand our awareness, and also strengthen our capacity for managing adversity in the future. When people are asked to identify the most important lessons learned in their lives, they frequently cite adverse circumstances as setting the stage for their most powerful learning experiences.\\n\\n**Step 6: Be Flexible**\\n\\nBe realistic about your abilities and goal attainment; be willing to modify your goals if circumstances have changed or if new information makes goal attainment unrealistic.\\n\\n**Step 7: Foster Warmth and Compassion**\\n\\nFoster warmth and compassion for others. Do the same for yourself. A [\\"loving kindness\\" audio script](https://soundcloud.com/ucsdmindfulness/20-min-loving-kindness-meditation-by-deborah-rana) can help to access deep feelings of compassion and empathy. \\n\\n**Step 8: Enhance Your Positive Emotions**\\n\\nEnhance your positive emotions by helping others, either with a kind word or gesture, or by volunteering. Keep a gratitude journal, writing down every few days a list of three things that you are grateful for, and what caused those three things to occur. \\n\\n**Step 9: Clarify Your Values and Goals**\\n\\nTake some time to clarify what you value and what you would like to have accomplished within a 1-5 year time frame, as well as what you would like to have accomplished by the end of your life. Use these values to establish more short-term goals (across 6-month, 1-month, 1-week, and 1-day time horizons). \\n\\n**Step 10: Focus Your Efforts and Monitor Your Progress**\\n\\nStart a daily questions list, rating yourself on a 1-10 scale by responding to items such as, \\"Did I try my best to be grateful?\\"; \\"Did I try my best to notice and focus on the positive?\\"; and \\"Did I try my best to deepen my close relationships?\\" \\n\\n**Key Point:** Trying one or more of these strategies can significantly improve your ability to develop and strengthen resilience. As a consequence, you will likely be more capable of handling the negative without giving up, focusing on your valued goals ahead and working toward them with a positive, optimistic, and self-compassionate mindset.", "title": "How to Strengthen Your Resilience", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 14:53:18.57134+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:00:00.418222+00	\N	f

VUCA is a term coined by the War College in the early 1990s. VUCA encompasses a host of personal and organizational stressors, which fall on police executives to understand and prepare for to minimize the resulting disruption and destabilization. To mitigate the effects of VUCA on police agencies, police leaders have a responsibility to build a resilient police force. One of the best ways to reduce VUCA's effect on organizations is to adequately understand how to build personal resilience for better operational outcomes while simultaneously improving officer well-being in general. VUCA's influence on the police cuts deeper than the acronym might state.\\n\\nThere are a host of detrimental costs associated with a non-resilient police force. Cynicism, relationship issues, substance abuse, and even death are the costs for officers who are ill-equipped to deal with the stressors of the job. Research in the expanding field of neuroplasticity and positive psychology has developed new insights that can benefit public safety in keeping officers healthy and vibrant in mind and body to ensure that they are prepared to take on an ever-complicated and chaotic workplace. The field of positive psychology has shown that happiness in the mind influences resilience in the body. Happiness guards against disease and deterioration of organ systems. It therefore stands to reason that to the same factors that promote happiness may also inoculate officers against stress.\\n\\nThe emerging science of neuroplasticity reveals that the brain is constantly changing. There are conditions under which deeply embedded emotional memories can be changed and updated; for instance, fear can be stripped out using a memory mismatch strategy as in Coherence Therapy or the reconsolidation of traumatic memories (RTM) protocol. Other emotional systems can be strengthened. Although genetic temperaments are deeply rooted in personality, character is more easily influenced. Character involves social learning as well as behavioral reinforcement, which indicates that it can change. Millions of people in self-help communities strengthen their own character to override addictive impulses. Similarly, character in officers can be strengthened as a bulwark against debilitating stress.\\n\\n**Antifragility**\\n\\nTo build this resiliency, the authors propose a strategy using the concept of antifragility. \\"Antifragility\\" is a term coined by statistician and author Dr. Nassim Taleb in his seminal book _Antifragile_. Taleb explains how a highly centralized, rigid, and therefore fragile system can fracture when visited by a \\"black swan\\" (totally unexpected) challenge in the realm of law enforcement, a black swan even might be, for instance, a mass shooting. Trauma can also fracture character. The sight of a child's burned body, an encounter with a suicidal adolescent, or the failure to prevent the death of a partner can fracture an officer's mind into disparate pieces. The technical term is \\"dissociation,\\" a central feature of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. \\n\\nThere is also a more insidious form of emotional degradation. Think of the expression \\"nibbled to death by ducks.\\" In this case, character isn't \\"fractured\\" by trauma but rather worn away by the slow compounding of daily stress. Many officers discount this potential effect because society has trained them to be \\"strong\\" and fearless. The reality, however, is that stress is eating away at their emotional foundation. Police agencies need a resilience training strategy that can handle this threat-ideally, a strategy that can bypass total reliance on the so-called helping professions (e.g., therapy and mental health services). When possible and practical, self-help and mutual help are the first way to go. \\n\\n**Resilience Strategy**\\n\\nOne strategy for strengthening character resilience involves four dimensions of antifragility:\\n\\n*   Diversified emotional resources\\n*   Capacity to generate and accumulate resources\\n*   Capacity to repair damage\\n*   Ability to strengthen oneself \\n\\nThese antifragile properties have parallels in organic life. The term \\"resources\\" refers to emotionally supportive memory. Emotional resources are filed in the unconscious. Research on happiness reveals that people who are strongly motivated by virtuous values will show greater anti-viral and anti-inflammatory genetic expression. This is not an entirely new concept - neurologist and psychologist Viktor Frankl may have been the first to explicitly make the connection between meaning and stress resilience in his 1946 book, Man's Search for Meaning. Strengthening antifragile character will necessarily involve strengthening implicit values and meaning. Practical methods to strengthen character are still evolving, but the following are possibilities for strengthening officers' resilience. \\n\\n**Diversified Emotional Resources** \\n\\nAn essential step in resilience training is to help officers evaluate the scope of meaning in their lives. An officer's self-definition that focuses on pride and image is a narrow view of character. Such a limited focus can lead to workaholism and cloud his or her true identity. More diversified emotional resources are required to be emotionally resilient. Psychologist Martin Seligman's seminal work on happiness defined different contributing value systems. His research suggests that authentic happiness derives from engagement with others as well as the pursuit of self-transcendent meaning. Self-rating scales can be constructed to evaluate how engaged a person is with others and the flow of ongoing productivity. Survey questions that assess the domains of social support, social integration, and the limitation of negative interactions are predictive of health. The Eduaimonic (happiness living with good virtues) Well-Being Scale is a survey that measures a person's degree of virtuous motivation. It can help an officer determine how well he or she is feeling a sense of meaning beyond mere pleasure or pride. We know that the sum of all these measures (e.g., engagement, productivity, sense of meaning) is not only predictive of health, but it is also predictive of resilience. Officers can use this assessment information to reset their own goals on how to live. They can then use emotional exercises to strengthen new core values. the desired outcome is for officers to find value in community, friendships, and the \\"flow\\" of work. Such a diversified character can take a hit and still stay afloat.\\n\\n**Capacity to Generate and Accumulate Resources**\\n\\nGeneration and accumulation of resources can take place over either short or long periods of time. A short restoration of emotional and biological resources occurs when a person takes a break at work. Rest and recovery (such as sleep and vacations) are inherent qualities of well-being and healthy lifestyle. \\n\\nMind-body medical expert Dr. Herbert Benson teaches the importance of using he \\"relaxation response\\" and meditation to reset stress hormones in the  body. Research has shown that meditative practices do more than reset stress hormones - they can physiologically adjust the neural networks that regulate stress. New technologies have emerged that amplify the benefits of mindfulness practices, including affordable biofeedback devices that track physiological measures such as heart rate variability and alpha brain wave dominance. Officers can be taught a 15-minutes mental hygiene regimen that can have profound effects on their health. \\n\\nA longer period of time may be required to accumulate new emotional resources. Developing a new close relationship may require months or even years. Training new skills for emotional regulation may also require time and practice. Officers who are willing to talk with each other with profound honesty can grow their own self-acceptance and self-compassion. Officer peer support groups usually promote this kind of growth. They allow officers to become more skilled at perceiving and labeling their own emotions. Doing so can physiologically dampen their fear and shame from VUCA experiences. \\n\\n**Capacity to Repair Damage**\\n\\nMental health providers are not the only wellness resource available for officers. Self and mutual help are often greatly undervalued. Research has established that nuanced labeling of emotion reduces anxiety . For example, shame is like mold - it grows in the \\"dark\\" and creates a host of problems. Normalizing fear by expressing it to others (bringing it into the light) is a healthy way to reduce it. It's important that officers reframe the concept of strength to incorporate acceptance of fear and shame. Strength equals flexibility, and an officer's fear of natural emotions can make him or her weak and brittle. Shame about feelings is an unneeded meta-emotion that plagues many public safety personnel. As an alternative, officers can be taught exercises that reduce this form of stress. For example, officers can use \\"feeling cards\\" to help them identify and normalize ambivalent emotions while telling their stories to a confidant. Sharing fear memories in a theme-focused group can also normalize fear in a similar manner. \\n\\nAt a deeper level, officers can be taught new methods to detoxify stronger traumas. Research on memory re consolidation indicates that fear and stress can be stripped from a recalled memory using a phenomenon known as novelty-mismatch. Some psychotherapies utilize this phenomenon by stimulating re organization of painful memories. Although officers are not equipped to self-treat childhood trauma, some of this technology can be used to reduce the pain in adult memories. Officers can be trained to help other officers through peer support networks. They can stop through a procedure that brings a contradictory memory into close association with a painful one. This mismatch can quickly reduce fear. \\n\\n**Ability to Strengthen Oneself**\\n\\nA benefit of mindfulness is that it can override impulse and retrain the mind. Officers can be taught the principle of \\"backward strengthening\\" whereby effortful behavior paired with mindfulness can strengthen core values in character. Millions of people have done this in 12-step addiction recovery programs. The 12 steps are all workout stations for strengthening the values of honesty, responsibility, and involvement. The theory is that whatever value people struggle for, they grow to love. If people struggle against their desire to appear perfect and instead express the truth of having violated certain values, then those values become more deeply held. Profound growth in character occurs in those who fight for it. Officers can be taught how to implement this strategy in their close relationships.\\n\\n**Conclusion** \\n\\nWhile a general overview of important topics has been introduced, police executives should understand that implementation can be complex but worthwhile. Police executives should seek training opportunities that take advantage of all aspects of the four components previously listed. While adoption of strategies in the aforementioned areas might take time for general adherence, the general strategy is sound and based upon the advice of authors who have experience within these areas. Some of these techniques are already successfully employed in psychological practice. As effective as some clinical techniques may be, the goal is not for officers and organizations to become primarily dependent on mental health services. It's more desirable that they first take control of their own self-help, using strategies and tools like those presented herein to strengthen their resilience.", "title": "Strengthening Resilience: Essentials for Officer Well-Being", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 14:54:34.851199+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:00:09.05603+00	\N	f

The reality is that most people are stronger, more resilient, and much more capable of enduring hardship than they assume. Most of us underestimate our potential and sell ourselves short in the face of crisis events.\\n\\nBy crisis events, we mean extreme negative events that overwhelm our normal capacity to cope. Common examples include natural disasters, mass shootings, and accidents leading to loss of life. Right now, we are living through an ongoing series of crises including extreme social unrest, the global pandemic, economic turmoil, and mass unemployment. \\n\\nStrong negative reactions are normal during crisis events: anger, disbelief, disgust, fear, and sadness are common emotions experienced by many. There can be a sense that your cup is running over as new demands continue to pour on – or that your cup has been knocked off the table – or that the table itself has been destroyed by forces outside of your control. \\n\\nYour responses and reactions to these situations are very important. Now is a perfect time to review specific actions that can help reinforce your coping and strengthen your resilience. You can even develop new skills and capabilities, leverage your strengths, and reveal untapped potential that would otherwise remain dormant, were it not for the impact of such extreme stressors.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**1\\\\. Embrace the Suck**\\n\\nIn the midst of chaotic and high-risk events, it is important to embrace the new reality as rapidly as possible. “Embrace the suck” is a term used in the military to capture the vital importance of fully accepting a situation as it is, no matter how negative, so that you can rapidly adjust to the new reality. Embracing the suck is often associated with a renewed sense of calm, because you are accepting what is, and once you embrace the suck of a situation, you can adjust your strategies and tactics to the new reality, maximizing your responsiveness and effectiveness.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**2\\\\. Safety First**\\n\\nSafety is the highest priority during crisis events. In the midst of the pandemic, for example, wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), minimize your exposure risk as much as possible, and stay current with [CDC guidelines and recommendations.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-law-enforcement.html) First responders and medical professionals serving on the front lines tend to place such a high priority on protecting and caring for others that their own safety and well-being can become deprioritized and compromised. Don’t let this happen to you – your own safety, health, and well-being are extremely important and must be protected.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Mission Control**\\n\\nCrisis events disrupt our sense of control and it’s critical to place yourself back in the driver’s seat as rapidly as possible. First, make a conscious decision to focus your time, effort, and energy on your “Sphere of Control” – those things which you can positively influence. There is only so much time in a day, so invest every precious minute on how you can make a positive difference. Second, remind yourself of your mission, your values, and your purpose in life – the things that matter most to you. Third, take steps to align your behaviors, your words, and your thinking with the ideal version of yourself. This way, your actions will better reflect your authentic goals and ideals, rather than a series of negative reactions to events outside of your control.  \\n\\n**4\\\\. Avoid Signature Risk Patterns**\\n\\nIn response to stressful events, our bodies release hormones that increase the risk of negative coping. Think of these stress-induced negative behaviors as signature risk patterns, whether it be eating too much junk food, spending too much time online, drinking too much, gambling, shoplifting, abusing drugs, or promiscuity. The key is to recognize your own signature risk pattern and take control to avoid going in an unhealthy direction.\\n\\n**5\\\\. Reinforce the Fundamentals**\\n\\nGetting plenty of exercise, sufficient sleep, eating healthy, and maintaining strong relationships are four well-established keys to maintaining physical and mental health and wellness. During crisis events, when normal routines and patterns have been disrupted, take the opportunity to double-down on the fundamentals of healthy living. Go out of your way to schedule time for exercise and sleep, force yourself (if necessary) to eat healthy and socialize with people you trust and who treat you well. Establishing and reinforcing these healthy patterns in your life will place you in a much stronger position over time. \\n\\n**6\\\\. Strengthen Your Mind**\\n\\nIt’s often been said that the greatest enemy we face is the one looking back at us in the mirror. Do not allow yourself to fall into patterns of negative thinking. Instead, practice deep breathing exercises (e.g., box breathing and combat breathing) and train yourself to clear your mind and strengthen your control over your thought processes. Just as you wouldn’t neglect your arms or legs or abs in the gym, don’t neglect your mind when working to keep yourself healthy and fit.\\n\\n**7\\\\. Reach Out**\\n\\nYou are not alone. Make sure to reach out and ask for help if you could use a hand. Reach out to trusted friends and family. Reach out to peer support, chaplain support, or a high-quality therapist. Call a help line. Also, reach out to colleagues, friends, family, and others who may also be experiencing challenges during these difficult times. Reassuring and comforting others can be one of the most effective ways to recover as a team. Lastly, always remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself and others who may be experiencing stress. \\n\\n**Wrapping it All Together**\\n\\nYour responses and reactions to crisis events can help strengthen your resilience and your wellness. Make sure to place yourself in control, prioritize safety, focus on what you can positively influence, prioritize your mental and physical wellness, and reach out for help. This too shall pass, and together we can get through anything.", "title": "7 Tips for Strengthening Resilience and Wellness During Social Unrest and COVID-19", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 14:57:48.552642+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 22:00:13.679436+00	\N	f

PTSD is a formal psychological disorder. However, many first responders suffer from emotional injuries that do not meet the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Also, because experiencing a PTSI of some degree is so common amongst those exposed to severe or repeated traumatic events, many clinicians and first responders prefer the term PTSI, which better embodies the strong potential for recovery and removes the stigma that some may associate with the term \\"disorder.\\" Many first responders remain high-functioning performers on the job while carrying the residual emotional weight of the extreme experiences they have encountered through their work. It is very important to recognize that PTSIs are not unusual amongst first responders who have experienced traumatic events, and support should be provided as soon as possible without waiting for the diagnostic criteria for PTSD to be met.

The emotional toll that this work can take often remains invisible but has a significant impact on many officers, their families, and their department. This can include problems with increased anger, depression, anxiety, and feeling burned out. These problems tend to progress gradually, and may not be noticed while they are developing. Officers may feel discouraged after making an error or being reprimanded by a supervisor. They may not notice the developing assumption that they are not competent, or that they are a failure as an officer. This generalized and inaccurate way of thinking can turn into full-blown depression, if not checked. Similarly, repeated incidents of frustration and anger may indicate that an angry outlook is becoming a habit, which can lead to problems at home and can interfere with work performance.\\n\\nAn important principle for the New Hire is to be proactive about managing emotional health. Be on the lookout for signs of negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, or anger, that may be lasting for many hours out of the day, or are occurring more days than not. The Self-Assessments within the app include quick screeners that can help you decide about taking steps to take charge of any problem emotions. In addition, the app has articles that offer guidance on ways to enhance and maintain your emotional well-being. Take a look at the modules on **Emotional Health** and **Depression**, for example, for helpful information on those topics.\\n\\nBecause first responder work can be very stressful, many officers find that when they go off shift, they become very lethargic and just want to “zone out.” This process is described in detail in Dr. Kevin Gilmartin’s excellent book, [_**Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement: A Guide for Officers and Their Families**_](https://hopeforheroes.com/buy/)_**.**_ Dr. Gilmartin described the “Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster,” which leads first responders to spend much of their off-duty time staring passively at TV (or computer or phone), returning to alertness only around the time they are due to go back on shift. This can have a harmful impact on relationships with family and friends, who may feel shut out or uncared for by their law enforcement family members. As a new officer, it is very important that you be aware of this all-too-common pattern, and that you commit in advance to ensure the well-being of your close relationships. The **Emotional Survival** module provides outstanding information on how this happens, and how you can guard against it. The Cordico app also includes a condensed summary of Dr. Gilmartin’s book, located within the Wellness Toolkit highlighting key topics and strategies for emotional survival. \\n\\nIt is often the case that family members or others close to an officer are amongst the first to notice when an officer’s attitudes and emotions begin to shift in a negative direction. When a spouse or others close to an officer provide feedback after noticing changes that raise concerns, it is important to avoid becoming defensive. Family members often see negative symptoms before officers themselves become aware of such symptoms, so listening to their concerns and taking time to consider their perspectives is important. When family takes the time to provide an officer with feedback, listening carefully is important as it helps to preserve high-quality relationships and can also provide valuable information that would otherwise go missed until problems worsen. Rather than allowing problems to worsen over time, feedback from family and other loved ones often provides important opportunities to deal with negative developments sooner rather than later.", "title": "Managing Emotional Health", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:46:00.68893+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:19:55.027768+00	\N	f

Symptoms usually begin early, within 3 months of the traumatic incident, but sometimes they begin years afterward. Symptoms must last more than a month to be considered PTSD. The course of the illness varies. Some people recover within 6 months, while others have symptoms that last much longer. In some people, the condition becomes chronic.\\n\\nA doctor who has experience helping people with mental illnesses, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, can diagnose PTSD.\\n\\n**To be diagnosed with PTSD, an adult must have all of the following for at least one month:**\\n\\n*   At least one re-experiencing symptom\\n*   At least one avoidance symptom\\n*   At least two arousal and reactivity symptoms\\n*   At least two cognition and mood symptoms\\n\\n**Re-experiencing symptoms include:**\\n\\n*   Flashbacks – reliving the trauma over and over, including physical symptoms like a racing heart or sweating\\n*   Bad dreams\\n*   Frightening thoughts\\n\\nRe-experiencing symptoms may cause problems in a person’s everyday routine. The symptoms can start from the person’s own thoughts and feelings. Words, objects, or situations that are reminders of the event can also trigger re-experiencing symptoms.\\n\\n**Avoidance symptoms include:**\\n\\n*   Staying away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience\\n*   Feeling emotionally numb\\n*   Feeling strong guilt, depression, or worry\\n*   Losing interest in activities that were enjoyable in the past\\n*   Having trouble remembering the dangerous event\\n\\nThings that remind a person of the traumatic event can trigger avoidance symptoms. These symptoms may cause a person to change his or her personal routine. For example, after a bad car accident, a person who usually drives may avoid driving or riding in a car.\\n\\n**Arousal and reactivity symptoms include:**\\n\\n*   Being easily startled\\n*   Feeling tense or “on edge”\\n*   Having difficulty sleeping\\n*   Having angry outbursts\\n\\nArousal symptoms are usually constant, instead of being triggered by things that remind one of the traumatic events. These symptoms can make the person feel stressed and angry. They may make it hard to do daily tasks, such as sleeping, eating, or concentrating.\\n\\n**Cognition and mood symptoms include:**\\n\\n*   Trouble remembering key features of the traumatic event\\n*   Negative thoughts about oneself or the world\\n*   Distorted feelings like guilt or blame\\n*   Loss of interest in enjoyable activities\\n*   Cognition and mood symptoms can begin or worsen after the traumatic event, but are not due to injury or substance use.\\n\\nThese symptoms can make the person feel alienated or detached from friends or family members.\\n\\nIt is natural to have some of these symptoms after a dangerous event. Sometimes people have very serious symptoms that go away after a few weeks. This is called acute stress disorder, or ASD. When the symptoms last more than a few weeks and become an ongoing problem, the person may have developed PTSD. Some people with PTSD don’t show any symptoms for weeks or months.

If children are present, try to ensure a secure area in which they can play with supervision. Ask about health concerns, such as needed medications, hearing aids or glasses, insulin, canes, or other healthcare items they may need. Ask if they have a friend or relative that you could help them to contact. You can enhance physical comfort by trying to ensure, if possible, a comfortable temperature, comfortable seating, and adequate lighting. Feelings of helplessness can be reduced by encouraging survivors to be engaged in helping themselves or others, such as by having them walk with you to get supplies, and encouraging them to exert some control over arranging their environment.\\n\\nIf possible, encourage social engagement among survivors, as it tends to be comforting to be around others who are coping effectively. At the same time, interacting with a highly distressed fellow survivor may be more upsetting than reassuring, and so your best judgment should be used. Children who have been separated from their caregivers are especially vulnerable to distress, and priority should be given to locating caregivers or others who can care for them. Use simple language to explain the situation, including who will watch over them and what will happen next. Provide realistic reassurance and comfort, but avoid making optimistic promises that cannot be kept, such as that they will see their parents soon.\\n\\nRemind survivors that overexposure to news about a traumatic event may cause worsening of emotional symptoms, especially in children and adolescents. Encourage them to thoughtfully monitor and reasonably limit the amount of time spent with such news. While updated information may be helpful or reassuring, constant replaying on news media of a traumatic situation is unhelpful. The National Center for PTSD guidelines recommend telling adults something like the following: \\"You've been through a lot, and it's a good idea to shield yourself and your children from further frightening or disturbing sights and sounds as much as possible. Even televised scenes of the disaster can be very disturbing to children. You may find that your children feel better if you limit their TV viewing of the disaster. It doesn't hurt for adults to take a break from all the media coverage, too.\\" (p. 32).\\n\\nAnother source of comfort includes providing information about what is known about the situation, what they can do next, what is being done to help them, and services that they can access. At the same time, you will need to use your best judgment about what information should be disclosed at what time; some individuals may be particularly fragile at the moment, and would be better served by learning at a later time about deaths or other severe harm that may have occurred. When a loved one has died in a crisis situation, there is no single way of reacting to such news. The National Center for PTSD encourages sensitivity to the individual's particular way of responding. They offer the following as an example of how to discuss grief with survivors: \\"It is important to know that each family member may express their grief differently. Some may not cry, while others might cry a lot. Family members should not feel badly about this or think there is something wrong with them.

Everyone is different, and PTSD affects people differently so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. It is important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health provider who is experienced with PTSD. Some people with PTSD need to try different treatments to find what works for their symptoms.\\n\\nIf someone with PTSD is going through an ongoing trauma, such as being in an abusive relationship, both of the problems need to be addressed. Other ongoing problems can include panic disorder, depression, substance abuse, and feeling suicidal.\\n\\n**Medications**\\n\\nThe most studied medications for treating PTSD include antidepressants, which may help control PTSD symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling numb inside. Antidepressants and other medications may be prescribed along with psychotherapy.\\n\\nDoctors and patients can work together to find the best medication or medication combination, as well as the right dose. Check the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) website for the latest information on patient medication guides, warnings, or newly approved medications.\\n\\n**Psychotherapy**\\n\\nPsychotherapy (sometimes called \\"talk therapy\\") involves talking with a mental health professional to treat a mental illness. Psychotherapy can occur one-on-one or in a group. Talk therapy treatment for PTSD usually lasts 6-12 weeks, but it can last longer. Research shows that support from family and friends can be an important part of therapy.\\n\\nMany types of psychotherapy can help people with PTSD. Some types target the symptoms of PTSD directly. Other therapies focus on social, family, or job-related problems. The doctor or therapist may combine different therapies depending on each person's needs.\\n\\nEffective psychotherapies tend to emphasize a few key components, including education about symptoms, teaching skills to help identify the triggers of symptoms, and skills to manage the symptoms. One helpful form of therapy is called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. CBT can include:\\n\\n*   **Exposure Therapy**  \\n    This helps people face and control their fear. It gradually exposes them to the trauma they experienced in a safe way. It uses imagining, writing, or visiting the place where the event happened. The therapist uses these tools to help people with PTSD cope with their feelings.\\n*   **Cognitive Restructuring**  \\n    This helps people make sense of the bad memories. Sometimes people remember the event differently than how it happened. They may feel guilt or shame about something that is not their fault. The therapist helps people with PTSD look at what happened in a realistic way. \\n\\n**How Talk Therapies Help People Overcome PTSD** \\n\\nTalk therapies teach people helpful ways to react to the frightening events that trigger their PTSD symptoms. Based on this general goal, different types of therapy may:\\n\\n*   Teach about trauma and its effects\\n*   Use relaxation and anger-control skills\\n*   Provide tips for better sleep, diet, and exercise habits\\n*   Help people identify and deal with guilt, shame, and other feelings about the event\\n*   Focus on changing how people react to their PTSD symptoms. For example, therapy helps people face reminders of the trauma.\\n\\n**EMDR**\\n\\nEMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a form of psychotherapy that helps some people recover from emotional distress associated with traumatic memories. EMDR has been recognized as an effective form of treatment for trauma and other disturbing experiences by the American Psychiatric Association, the Department of Defense, and the World Health Organization. You can learn more about EMDR by [clicking here](https://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/). \\n\\n**Treatment Options** \\n\\nPeople with PTSD should talk about all treatment options with a therapist. Treatment should equip individuals with the skills to manage their symptoms and help them participate in activities that they enjoyed before developing PTSD.", "title": "Treatments and Therapies", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 17:05:38.788298+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:56:00.796999+00	\N	f

The way a family is notified can have effects for many years. One of the concerns that has been happening much too often is survivors finding out about their loved one’s death through social media.\\n*   The policy should include an appropriate timeframe after all family members are notified before any of the following actions occur:\\n    *   Profile pictures updated to the department’s badge Post requests for “prayers for the officer and their family”\\n    *   Sharing the local “breaking news” posts\\n\\nAlthough these things are done with good intentions, these posts can be devastating to survivors who have not been officially notified by the department.\\n\\n**“In Person”**\\n\\n*   Always make the notification in person – not by phone.\\n*   Arrange personal notification even if the survivor lives far away.\\n*   Never talk about the officer’s death over the police radio. Too many people and the media have scanners.\\n\\n**“In Time” – and with certainty**\\n\\n*   Provide notification as soon as possible and with certainty. Notify next of kin and others who live in the same household. Offer to notify parents, adult children and siblings.\\n*   The speed news passes through social media makes it important to get there very quickly if the agency is to have any chance of notifying the family before they hear about it through social media or through a friend who saw the incident on social media.\\n\\n**“In Pairs”**\\n\\n*   Always have 2 people present for the notification. C.O.P.S. does not recommend waiting for the highest official of the agency to be present for the notification unless they can also get there the quickest in an attempt to beat social media. C.O.P.S. recommends sending an on duty supervisor with another officer to the house.\\n*   Take separate vehicles. One officer may need to stay at the residence with children while the adults proceed to the hospital, one may need to stay until other family members can respond to the homestead, etc.\\n*   Notifiers should plan the notification procedure; who will say what and how much information is there to be given to the family.\\n\\n**“In Plain Language”**\\n\\n*   Law enforcement families will know there is a serious problem as soon as they respond to the infamous, devastating knock at the door. But try not to make the notification on the door step. Ask to come in, gather the family, and attempt to get everyone seated.\\n*   It is up to the surviving parent how the children are told. If children are present, ask to speak to the parent alone. Offer to notify the children, but take the direction from the surviving parent.\\n*   Avoid vague expressions like “passed away”. Use words like “died” or “killed”. Speak slowly and carefully and inform them that “Bob responded to a domestic disturbance call today and upon his arrival at the residence, Bob was shot and died.” Do NOT drag out the details; but don’t rush through them either.\\n*   Call the victim by name—rather than “the body”.\\n*   Patiently answer any questions about the death, location of the body, etc. If you don’t know the answer, tell them so and get that information for them as soon as possible.\\n\\n**“With Compassion”**\\n\\n*   Accept the survivors’ emotions and your own. Allow tears to be shed and never try to talk survivors out of their grief.\\n*   Never offer false hope. If the officer has died, please tell them that.\\n*   Do not impose your own religious beliefs and stay away from the God clichés; “It was God’s will”, etc.\\n*   Never simply notify and leave.\\n*   Do not take the victim’s personal items with you at the time of notification.\\n*   If death has not yet occurred, get the family to the hospital as soon as possible in a department vehicle.\\n*   Should the survivors want to see the officer, prepare them for what they will see in the trauma room. If they want to be with the officer as they die or shortly after death has occurred, make that happen.   \\n    **DENYING THE FAMILY ACCESS TO THE BODY IS NOT AN ACT OF KINDNESS.**\\n*   Stay with the family at the hospital and provide transportation back to the residence.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n\\\\*These Basic Death Notification Procedures, “In Person, In Time”, were prepared by Dr. Thomas L.

It involves a range of emotions – emotions you didn’t know existed, in addition to those you are familiar with, at a depth and intensity that you never imagined. \\n\\nFor some, the craziness of grief shows up in extreme behaviors. You may find yourself engaging in frenzied activity, whether washing the car or working. Using activity as an outlet for intense feelings or as a break from the wearying tasks of mourning can be healthy. Using it to avoid the pain of grief or engaging in behaviors that are hurtful to yourself and others is not. \\n\\nWhile grief is a normal reaction to a significant loss, everyone reacts differently. There is no “right” or “wrong” way to experience grief. Over your career, you may react differently to similar circumstances that occur years apart. One person’s response may be totally different that another person’s. The intensity of these emotions can be more than your friends and family can tolerate. You may find relief in talking to an experienced mental health professional. \\n\\n**WHAT ARE THE MENTAL EFFECTS OF GRIEF?** \\n\\nTrauma changes your chemical make-up and brain wave function; which in turn impacts everything you do. It can make you think crazy thoughts and do crazy things; you may not be able to concentrate and remember how to do basic tasks. It’s maddening, but it’s normal. Although it is easier said than done, try to be patient with yourself. If you must make decisions, talk them over with the people you trust. \\n\\nThere may be a part of you that cannot believe what happened is really true. You may find yourself inventing crazy scenarios that better explain why this person is gone. Your inability to accept what has happened is a reflection of the enormity of your loss, not of your mental health. Don’t let anyone try to convince you otherwise. \\n\\n**WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF GRIEF?** \\n\\nHeadaches, sleep disturbances, muscle tension, rapid heartbeat, nausea, aches and pains, compromised immunity, and stomach pain are just a few ways grief can manifest itself physically. If you already have a medical condition, grief may impact that as well. Stay in touch with your doctor; force yourself, if you have to, so that your physical health can be monitored. There’s no point in adding an unnecessary level of stress to your life. The only way to get on the other side of grief is to slog through it. Grief can be postponed, but it cannot be dodged, skirted or gone under or over. And remember, as painful and as crazy-making as grief is, the intensity of the grief is testimony to the power of your love and the significance of your loss. \\n\\n**APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS WHILE GRIEVING**\\n\\n*   Your grief may take longer to end than most people think. \\n*   Your grief may take more energy than you would have ever imagined.\\n*   Your grief may involve many changes and always be developing. \\n*   Your grief may show itself in all spheres of your life: psychological, social and physical. \\n*   Your grief may depend upon how you perceive the loss. w You may grieve for many things, both symbolic and tangible, not just the death alone. w You may grieve for what you have lost and for the future of unfulfilled expectations you held with that person, and for the needs that will go unmet because of the death. \\n*   Your grief may involve a variety of feelings and reactions, not solely those that are generally thought of as grief, such as depression and sadness. \\n*   The loss may resurrect old issues, feelings and unresolved conflicts from the past. \\n*   You may have some identity confusion as a result of this major loss and the fact that you are experiencing reactions that may be quite different.\\n*   You may have a combination of anger and depression, such as irritability, frustration and annoyance or intolerance.\\n*   You may feel some anger and survivor guilt, or at least some manifestation of these emotions. \\n*   You may have a lack of self-concern.\\n*   You may experience grief spasms – surges of grief that occur suddenly without warning.\\n*   You may have trouble thinking (memory, organization and intellectual processing) and making decisions. \\n*   You may feel like you are going crazy.\\n*   You may be obsessed with the death and preoccupied with the deceased.\\n*   You may begin a search for meaning and may question your religion and/or philosophy of life.\\n*   You may find yourself acting socially in ways that are different than before. \\n*   You may find yourself having a number of physical reactions.\\n*   You may find that there are certain dates, events and stimuli that cause surges in grief. \\n*   Society may have unrealistic expectations about your mourning and may respond inappropriately to you.\\n*   Certain experiences later in life may temporarily resurrect feelings of intense grief. \\n\\n**INCIDENT DEBRIEFING** \\n\\nMany law enforcement agencies have developed Critical Incident Stress Management Teams that provide emotional support following traumatic incidents. It is highly recommended that an agency that loses an officer in the line of duty hold a defusing within 12-24 hours of the incident and debriefings following the funeral. These are NOT to critique the actions of officers, but to address the emotional issues that the incident has created for officers/ department employees (don’t forget dispatchers, forensic teams, or clerks) involved in the incident. \\n\\n**SURVIVOR GUILT** \\n\\nA follow-up debriefing for all involved in the incident is also recommended shortly after the funeral of the fallen officer to ensure people are coping with the incident as good as can be expected. “Survivor guilt” is often experienced by those intimately involved in a life-claiming incident. The question of “Why them and not me?” can eat away at a co-worker and lead to chronic depression, post-traumatic stress injury, and even thoughts of suicide. If you or someone you know is experiencing “survivor guilt”, seek professional counseling.", "title": "Dealing with Grief Within the Agency", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 19:09:58.071375+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:51:35.545334+00	\N	f

This includes surviving family members of the officer as well as co-workers in your agency. The PDF below [](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/ac5c0731/files/uploaded/Grief%20complications.pdf)includes detailed information of signs to look for.\\n\\n[![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/button_tap_to_view_pdf_1_3.png)](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/ac5c0731/files/uploaded/Grief%20complications.pdf)\\n\\nYou must respect a person’s way of coping with loss, while at the same time looking for signs and symptoms of potentially serious complications that could be relieved. The following are symptoms that should be immediately addressed by a professional, even if the person is grief-stricken:\\n\\n*   Talking about suicide.\\n*   Unable to function for weeks to months after the death.\\n*   Abuses alcohol and/or drugs.\\n*   Shows signs of severe major depression or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\\n*   Although grief resembles major depression in many ways, a skilled clinician can determine whether a bereaved person is suffering with depression. It is wrong to assume that a bereaved person with major depression symptoms is just having a “normal” reaction, since depression is a serious, but treatable, disorder. When the death is shocking and unexpected, there also can be symptoms of PTSD.\\n\\n**UNDERSTANDING POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS (PTS)**\\n\\nIt is completely normal for an officer who has experienced a traumatic event to experience stress following the event. Some of the reactions of this stress injury could include:\\n\\n*   Re-experiencing the traumatic event through painful, intrusive thoughts or nightmares about the death.\\n*   Avoidance or emotional numbing, as indicated by efforts to stay away from activities, places or things related to the person’s death.\\n*   Feeling detached from others and an inability to feel positive emotions\\n*   Increased persistent anxiety and physiological arousal, as indicated by difficulty sleeping, irritability, difficulty concentrating and a tendency to become easily startled.\\n\\nAlthough many of these symptoms are common following a traumatic event, if they remain persistent over time and begin to interfere in normal activities and relationships, the officer’s traumatic injury may need immediate treatment. Thankfully, traumatic injuries are treatable and most officers are capable of working through the trauma and returning to a healthy life.\\n\\n**AFTER LOSS, HOW LONG WILL THE FEELINGS LAST?**\\n\\nBecause survivors must often come to terms with not only the death itself, but the manner of the death (e.g. if it was violent or painful), it can take many months for the most painful feelings and thoughts to go away.\\n\\nIt is common to worry about what the person experienced during his or her final moments of life. If other people were directly or indirectly responsible for the death, the survivor must struggle with the realization that others can and will commit evil acts. This awareness can provoke intense reactions, such as powerful rage toward the person (or people) responsible.\\n\\nIf the death was a result of a crash or mistake, grief reactions may be clouded by confusion since there isn’t someone to blame or hold responsible.\\n\\nIf a loved one’s death was not in the line of duty but by suicide or drug overdose, anger, shame, guilt and feeling abandoned by the deceased are common emotions.\\n\\nIt also may take longer to deal with the loss if the survivor:\\n\\n*   Has previously experienced psychological problems, such as major depression or separation anxiety.\\n*   Was very dependent (e.g., financially and emotionally) on the person who died.\\n*   Has experienced previous trauma or traumatic loss, especially if it is similar in some way to this loss.\\n*   Has few friends or relatives who are supportive.\\n*   Is simultaneously coping with other serious concerns, such as major health problems, psychosocial stresses or other losses.\\n\\nAs the initial shock of the death wears off, there may be times when the survivor can focus on other issues and not feel the pain of the loss so intensely. Gradually, these moments will become longer, and there will be more good days and fewer bad days.\\n\\nHowever, people can experience setbacks during the process. People often have difficulty dealing with occasions such as holidays, birthdays, the anniversary date of the death, or other times that have meaning.\\n\\nResearch suggests that if after six months the grief has not become easier to bear, the bereaved person should take extra steps to help the process along.\\n\\n**WHEN IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP?**\\n\\nIf the intensity of grief is still strong after six months, and there are symptoms of PTSD or major depression, or if these reactions interfere with other parts of normal life, such as holding a job, ask for support from a professional. Also, any of the following experiences suggest that professional help may be needed:\\n\\n*   Continuing to experience intense yearning for the deceased that does not diminish over time.\\n*   Struggling with feelings of guilt or uncontrollable rage.\\n*   Becoming severely depressed and feeling hopeless about the future.\\n*   Harboring persistent suicidal thoughts.\\n*   Abusing alcohol or drugs, or increasing tobacco use.\\n\\n**TREATMENT CAN HELP**\\n\\nNo matter how long someone has been suffering from the impact of a sudden, traumatic loss, comforting and effective treatments are available. It is important for survivors of sudden, traumatic loss to select a therapist who is experienced in treating both trauma and bereavement. Many psychotherapies and support groups are available. Medication and psychotherapy may be effective with symptoms of depression and PTSD.\\n\\nIn addition, temporary medication may be useful tor those who experience intense anxiety or insomnia. A family doctor, clergy person, local mental health association, state psychiatric, psychological or social work association, or health insurer may be able to provide a referral to a counselor or therapist with experience in treating sudden, traumatic loss.\\n\\n_© 2005 Traumatic Loss Revised.

When visiting, don’t be afraid to use the deceased officer’s name or ask, “How are you doing since Jim’s death?” if something needs to be done around their home, get it done.\\n*   Always observe the officer’s death date with a short note to the family and/or flowers on the grave.\\n*   All holidays are traumatic events for the family the first year. Show your support during these times.\\n*   Remembrance books may be presented to the family. They can include anecdotes, pictures and newspaper articles of incidences the fallen officer worked. These remembrance books become treasures, especially if the children were too young to remember their parent when he or she was killed.\\n*   Don’t make idle promises to the surviving family.

Being able to respond effectively time after time requires a high degree of training and preparation, both in the academy and on the job. In addition, it is important to maintain this high degree of readiness across your career. The following article draws from the book, [_Peak Performance_](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Performance-Elevate-Burnout-Science/dp/162336793X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1538434368&sr=8-3&keywords=peak+performance)_,_ (2017) by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness. The authors review cutting edge scientific research on people who perform at the highest levels, describing the principles that help them attain extraordinary success.\\n\\nWorld-class athletes, professional musicians, international chess masters, and others who perform at exceptionally high levels follow core principles in their routines. While some principles are obvious – many hours of practice and preparation, and dedication to improvement – one of the most important principles is not at all obvious. This principle, supported by scientific research and followed by elite performers, is **REST**. This concept is highlighted and emphasized because it is so easy to take it for granted – “sure, everyone knows rest is important” – and to ignore the importance of _intentionally planning_ adequate rest in maintaining peak performance. \\n\\nMany people who want to perform at a high level assume that hard work and long hours are the most important ingredients for success, and that being tired and under-slept is just a natural part of trying to be the best. However, elite performers almost invariably prioritize getting optimal amounts of rest. While everyone knows that weight lifting increases muscle mass, strenuously exercising the same muscles every day would result in muscle injury rather than muscle growth. The book, [_Peak Performance_](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Performance-Elevate-Burnout-Science/dp/162336793X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1538434368&sr=8-3&keywords=peak+performance), notes that it is not just the stress of lifting weights, but the process of lifting weights _and then recovering_ that promotes muscle growth. The rest period is an active process of rebuilding, and muscles will increase in strength only if this essential rest phase occurs. The same principle applies to reaching optimal performance in other areas, whether in competitive chess, business, or patrolling a dangerous neighborhood. The stress of training and learning new skills should be followed by periods of deliberate rest, allowing for recovery and growth both physically and mentally. \\n\\nEven when you are simply trying to maintain a high level of performance in your job, intentionally building in periods of genuine rest and recovery is important. This principle applies to mental activity and growth as well as to the physical improvement seen with weight-lifting. In studies of performance in a range of professions elite performers invariably follow a cycle of intense training, followed by periods of enjoyable and restorative activities, such getting together with friends, playing on a sports team, or focusing on their family. Importantly, these activities are **_unrelated to training_**. This pattern of leaving training or intense work completely behind for periods of time can serve as a powerful strategy for maintaining a high level of performance. This deliberate disengagement from training or work allows for new insights and ideas about work performance. It can deepen your understanding of your work and how to be most effective. These periods of rest and recovery also help to prevent the burnout that can occur when work is always on one’s mind. Making the choice to actively disengage from work for extended blocks of time can help you maintain your best performance, and foster deeper satisfaction and commitment to your career.", "title": "Overview", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:11:29.994477+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:28:46.85218+00	\N	f

Peer support team members are trained to listen with a particular set of skills; assess the nature of the problem; and, when helpful, refer their first responder peers to appropriate professionals.\\n\\nFirst responders are exposed to stressful and dangerous situations much more often than most people, and sometimes these experiences can be distressing enough that you may benefit from getting some support. You may find it more comfortable to approach a trained peer support member instead of seeing a mental health professional, as your peer support member will be very familiar with the experiences, and you will probably find it easier to relate to another first responder.\\n\\nPeer support members can be useful when you may be need to talk about a difficult issue, but don't necessarily want to see a mental health professional. With their training, peer support members can help in many ways:\\n\\n*   Helping to process the experience after disturbing job-related events\\n*   Listening supportively after an emotionally intense situation, and providing useful suggestions for coping\\n*   Helping to problem-solve with life stressors, at work or at home\\n*   Advocating on your behalf if you need work accommodations, access to services, or help in resolving a difficult issue at work\\n*   Providing support and guidance in grief management after a significant loss\\n*   Private discussions of concerns about alcohol or other substance use problems\\n*   Supporting resiliency and stress management\\n*   Assisting with referrals to professionals\\n\\nExpanding on the last point, peer support members can help to identify difficulties that are best dealt with by a specialist, and so may recommend referral for a specific form of treatment. For example, a peer support specialist may provide initial help in talking through an event that involved loss of life, and then may recommend seeing an experienced trauma and PTSD specialist through your EAP for more comprehensive treatment.\\n\\nYou can also acquire much useful information from accessing peer support, such as helpful coping strategies, problem-solving techniques, stress management methods, and ways of dealing effectively with the challenges that first responders face. Finally, peer support members can often serve as helpful examples of how to successfully cope with work-related challenges, recovering from setbacks, and remaining steady on the job.\\n\\nIf your department or agency has a peer support program, consider accessing this resource whenever you have questions or feel you could benefit from advice, strategies for becoming more effective and more resilient.\\n\\nIf you are interested in developing a new peer support program at your agency, or updating your current peer support program, there are many helpful resources available. The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) offers [Peer Support Guidelines](https://www.cordico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IACP-Peer-Support-Guidelines.pdf) ratified by the IACP Police Psychological Services Section. Additionally, a more comprehensive manual for Peer Support programs in law enforcement may be found [here](http://post.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/postnvgov/content/Training/PST%20Manual%203rd%20E-version.pdf).\\n\\nUtilizing an existing peer support program can be very helpful in keeping you fit and effective on the job.

Think of our pre-historic ancestors, who may have barely escaped starvation during a long winter. During the following Spring, Summer, and Fall, their minds would likely go back again and again to the possibility of starving during the next Winter. Their ability to worry about the future serves two important functions: it identifies an important future threat (possible starvation) and energizes and motivates them to take action to prevent the threat. After all, it's not enough to simply recognize that you might starve in the future if you don't also experience motivation to do something about it.\\n\\nOur prehistoric ancestors did not likely enjoy worrying, and in fact, probably found it unpleasant to think about the possibility of future starvation. But because the worrying prompted efforts to gather, preserve, store, and safeguard food for the winter, it served an adaptive purpose in keeping our ancestors alive. Other humans alive at the same time who lacked the predisposition to worry often would not have survived to pass along their more carefree traits to later generations. \\n\\nAnd so our ability to worry has been passed down from ancestors who survived in part because they were able to worry, and for the most part, this ability is helpful. However, some people develop a pattern of worrying excessively, so that they worry about events they cannot control, or continue to worry about a task they have already completed. When worrying becomes excessive and persistent, it can interfere with sleeping adequately, because the worrying causes arousal in the nervous system, which delays sleep onset. Excessive worrying can also interfere with attention and concentration because the worried thoughts tap into some of the limited cognitive resources that we rely upon to remain focused and present at the moment. Worry thoughts can also lead to poorer sleep, poorer job performance, and then, even more, worry as concerns about mistakes at work or being unable to sleep become more prominent. In this manner, the worry process can become a vicious cycle, causing distress and interfering with effectiveness, which in turn leads to more worry.", "title": "Anxiety and Worry", "summary": "Just as the fight-or-flight response is a useful mechanism for protecting us during an immediate threat, the ability to anticipate dangers that might occur helps to keep us safe by planning ways to prevent these future threats.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-20 19:08:12.348459+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 21:32:56.216995+00	\N	f

There are many available resources for audio-guided mindfulness meditation ([click here for an example](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mpeg/01_Breathing_Meditation.mp3)).\\n\\nHere are some helpful mindfulness meditation guidelines:\\n\\n*   Find a time when you will be free from distractions for several minutes.\\n*   Sit comfortably, preferably with both feet on the ground and the back fairly upright.\\n*   Use a timer on your phone to alert you when the target amount of time has passed. This way you won't be distracted by trying to keep track of time.\\n*   Breathe through the nose at a normal pace.\\n*   Focus your attention on the sensations of breathing, including the movement of air in the nostrils, and the rise and fall of the belly with each breath. When irrelevant thoughts begin to show up, notice them, and then let them go and return your attention to the sensations of breathing.\\n*   Start at just 1-2 minutes. After a few days of practice, start adding 30 seconds or so until you can meditate for 5-10 minutes or more daily.\\n*   Try to meditate each day, even if you have only a few minutes. It is preferable to meditate regularly in small amounts, rather than miss several days of meditation waiting for a large block of time.\\n*   Take your mindful practice into your daily activities, noticing colors, sounds, and textures, and allowing distracting worries to fade while you bring your attention back to the present moment.", "title": "Mindfulness Meditation for Peak Performance", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:15:06.918776+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:29:42.549428+00	\N	f

Well-known healthy behaviors that have been repeatedly linked to improved health and increased lifespan include: not smoking, exercising regularly, avoiding or limiting alcohol use, getting 7 or more hours of sleep, and maintain a healthy weight. However, these behaviors are easier to list than to follow according to a recent CDC report (2013), only 6% of Americans report following all five of these healthy habits; only 35% engage in even three of these behaviors consistently. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/Behavioral_Health_Tools_Cordico_Copyrighted1.jpg)  \\nMany have noticed a frustrating feature of these healthy behaviors. If we get off track for one of the healthy behaviors, we tend to find it harder to continue or begin the others. For example, feeling overwhelmed and stressed by work leads some people to sleep poorly, which can make it more difficult to get up and exercise in the morning, or have the energy to exercise in the evening. It also makes us more likely to buy low-effort but high-calorie foods rather than preparing meals that help keep us at a healthy weight. Former smokers may find themselves starting up their smoking habit again when stressed, and after doing so, it becomes all the more difficult to return to healthier habits. Once started, simple behavioral inertia can result in a person becoming sedentary, gaining weight, sleeping poorly, drinking more alcohol, and in some cases, smoking. Other healthy behaviors can also fall by the wayside when we are stressed by the demands of work or family.

When these factors are not addressed, they may gradually erode life satisfaction and the ability to work effectively. The following guidelines can help you identify ways to avoid compassion fatigue. \\n\\n**Adequate Self-Care**\\n\\nIt is important to ensure that you regularly get enough time off work so that you can give yourself a period of distance and relief from the stressors of work. Self-care includes getting regular exercise, reserving time to spend with family and friends, and protecting time for adequate sleep. For some, self-care may include working on hobbies or playing on team sports. Others may be rejuvenated by periods of unstructured time for reflection or rest. Although correctional officers' and correctional staff's schedules are often demanding, it is important to intentionally plan for enjoyable or satisfying activities when not on duty. These may involve reading, watching movies, yard work, going out to dinner, cooking, traveling, and so on. The important element is to intentionally plan for these activities to ensure that fatigue or inactivity do not keep you from these self-care activities.\\n\\n**Address Unresolved Trauma Exposure**\\n\\nCorrectional officers and correctional staff may be exposed to trauma numerous times in the line of duty. Some may also have experienced traumatic events before entering the profession. Although for some the effects of traumatic exposure will resolve naturally, others will continue to be bothered by unwanted memories or nightmares of the trauma, or may have excessive feelings of guilt, anger, or mistrust that cause problems in interactions with co-workers or inmates. Taking time to process these traumatic events, either with a peer support member or behavioral health trauma specialist, can clear away the effects of the unresolved trauma, and help prevent compassion fatigue from developing. \\n\\n**Keep a High Positive-to-Negative Ratio**\\n\\nStudies indicate that people who are functioning at a high-level report experiencing positive emotions significantly more often than negative emotions. In one study, a 3 to 1 ratio for the frequency of experiencing positive versus negative emotions was associated with excellent function in work, relationships, and life satisfaction. A similar ratio applies to functioning effectively with co-workers (as well as marital relationships). A ratio of 5 positive interactions to every 1 negative interaction was associated with very strong levels of work productivity and interpersonal functioning.\\n\\nThese findings suggest that your risk for compassion fatigue may be reduced by actively seeking ways to promote positive emotions throughout the day. You can do so by intentionally seeking interactions or activities that usually brighten your mood. And when you are unable to change circumstances as you might like, you can still create positive emotions by actively looking for things to appreciate in your current situation. This could include looking for opportunities to appreciate success in one’s own work, enjoying your environment (a visual feature of a landscape or cityscape that you never noticed before), or an admirable characteristic of a colleague or member of the public.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/408/817503/365.jpg)\\n\\nDownload the **365 Gratitude Journal** app available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/365-gratitude-self-care/id1072397377) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gratitude.challenge&hl=en_US). \\n\\n_365 Gratitude is not just your average journal! It is a science-based self-care toolkit that will motivate you to build habits of positivity through self-love and compassion_\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Seeking Elevation**\\n\\nShifting your attention to the positive in others can give you an increased emotional positive-to-negative ratio. As you intentionally seek to notice the admirable characteristics of others, you may have the experience of “elevation.” This refers to a positive, warm emotional response that occurs when we see others demonstrating moral beauty or behaving virtuously. Examples include the humbling and inspiring feelings experienced when we see others behaving heroically, honorably, selflessly, or in services of others. Experiencing elevation motivates us to help others and connect with them, and creates powerful positive emotions. An important result of experiencing elevation is that it promotes an increased desire to be helpful and to care for those in distress – in other words, it can help to prevent or reverse compassion fatigue.", "title": "Addressing Compassion Fatigue", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 18:46:04.394768+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 18:46:04.394768+00	\N	f

In the field of trauma research, this includes what appears to have been an accidental finding that intrusive memories of disturbing events can be reduced by reactivating the memories and then engaging in a demanding visual task. Several carefully conducted scientific studies have replicated and confirmed that engaging in 10 to 20 minutes of the visual task can significantly reduce the frequency of disturbing intrusive memories (apparently by interfering with the reconsolidation of the disturbing memory), and these findings have been published in several highly regarded scientific journals. We are emphasizing the scientific support for these findings because the visual task may seem like a ridiculous technique for reducing effects of trauma: the visual task in these studies involved playing the video game Tetris. \\n\\nAt Cordico, we take scientific research and evidence very seriously. A fundamental principle in developing the Cordico wellness app is that only carefully vetted, scientifically supported findings and recommendations are to be included. We make it clear when a technique or strategy has not received enough scientific attention to be considered well-supported. In developing this app, we carefully review the research literature to exclude bogus treatments and inaccurate claims about wellness practices. With this in mind, the scientific basis for the strategic use of visual tasks for intrusive memories is fairly strong: there are more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies in which re-activating the disturbing memory and then playing Tetris or a similar visual task resulted in significant reductions in the frequency of intrusive memories. In other words, even though the use of Tetris to reduce intrusive memories may sound like nonsense, there is solid scientific support behind this approach.

Those who played Tetris for 20 minutes were found to experience significantly fewer intrusive memories over the following days compared with those who wrote in an activity log.

0caf0bd3-b968-47ab-80ce-9b05856e5f36	LE - Parenting Tips for Law Enforcement - Reducing Problem Behaviors	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Reducing Problem Behaviors**\\n\\n\\nThe best way to reduce a problem behavior is to reinforce the positive opposite of that behavior. You can also reduce a problem behavior by reinforcing essentially any other behavior. If a child has been tantruming, you can praise them anytime they are not having a tantrum (e.g., “I like how you are keeping your voice quiet”) even if the behavior is not the positive opposite. Perhaps surprisingly, you can even give reinforcement simply for doing the undesirable behavior less frequently. For example, if a child has been getting angry with his siblings every 5 minutes, a parent could praise them immediately after getting angry later by saying, “I’m really glad that you went 15 minutes without getting angry! You really acted like a big kid!” This calls attention to the desired behavior, reinforces growth, changes the direction of the parent’s attention to positive, and often stops negative behavior in its tracks.\\n\\n**Key Points for Using Reinforcers:**\\n\\n*   Provide the reinforcer immediately after the desired behavior when possible.\\n*   Say exactly what the behavior is that earned the reinforcer.\\n*   Use a high-quality reinforcer (enthusiastic praise; enough points to quickly earn reward for new behavior).\\n*   Start by reinforcing every time the behavior occurs at first, then fade. \\n\\n**Using Punishment**\\n\\nMany parents are skeptical when child “experts” say that punishment is not as effective as reinforcement for changing behavior. Parents are concerned that their children will become “spoiled” or always “need a prize.” However, research repeatedly shows that punishment is both less effective than reinforcement at producing positive behavior changes, and that punishment has negative effects on the child and on the parent-child relationship that reinforcement does not cause.\\n\\nAlthough it should be far outweighed by the use of reinforcement through parental attention and praise, there can be a role for punishment. The most widely accepted form of punishment is a time-out, in which the child is cutoff from enjoyable activities or other reinforcers, including parental attention. If you assign a time-out, it can be quite brief – 1-2 minutes of time-out is just as effective as 10 minutes of time-out, and going beyond 10 minutes actually starts to weaken the effectiveness of the time-out. Excessive punishments are unhelpful, are usually more about the parent’s emotions, and harm the parent-child relationship. The best practice is to provide a brief time out to specifically reinforce this is a known unwanted behavior (drawing on the wall, striking a sibling, jumping on furniture), followed by having the child take responsibility for the behavior, and immediately redirecting their behavior towards the desired behavior and praise. \\n\\n**Key Points for Using Punishment** \\n\\n*   Focus primarily on reinforcing the positive opposite of a problem behavior, through parental attention, praise, or a point chart. \\n*   If you use punishment make sure that it is not excessive, and drives children towards the desired behavior. \\n*   For time-out punishments for younger children, don’t interact with them for the 1-2 minutes that they are in time-out, as your attention is a form of reinforcement.\\n\\n**Summary of Managing Children’s Behavior**\\n\\nIt can be a challenge to set limits and develop good behavior in your child while still maintaining a close, loving connection with them. By keeping an eye out all the time for the positive, desirable behaviors that your child is doing, and reinforcing it with praise and attention, you can increase the behaviors that are important for your child’s development, while at the same time adding more and more instances of positive experiences and positive emotions linking you and your child. If there is a problem behavior, try to identify what the “positive opposite” of that behavior is, and reinforce it with praise and attention, and with a point chart if necessary. If you use punishment, time-out from enjoyable activities is the most effective and least risky form of punishment. Time-outs should be brief, and mild; harsher punishments for longer durations do not work better, and usually have negative side effects. The more you can rely on using your praise and attention to shape your child's behavior, the more likely you will build: a stronger parent-child relationship; a more positive relationship; a more competent child; and, a more self-confident child.", "title": "Reducing Problem Behaviors", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:34:41.584104+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:26:17.718914+00	\N	f

But people at the top of their field make sleep a priority. One reason for doing so is that they know that they can bring their best performance only if they are restored and recovered from the stresses of the day before. In addition, after a complete night of sleep they are able to complete more work overall, and at a higher level of quality, than if they cut corners on sleep for the sake of finishing tasks. If it makes you feel inefficient to schedule adequate sleep, try re-framing a full night's sleep as an activity that maximizes your overall productivity.\\n\\nSleep experts have numerous recommendations for enhancing your sleep: \\n\\n*   Use the bed for sleep and sex only; don't watch TV or use your phone in bed, as these cause wakefulness.\\n*   Exercise regularly to make it easier to fall asleep and improve sleep quality. Avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as exercise can increase alertness for a period of time.\\n*   Avoid alcohol and caffeine close to sleep. Alcohol disrupts deep sleep stages, and caffeine interferes with falling asleep for several hours after it is consumed. \\n*   If worrisome thoughts interfere with sleep onset, try practicing a few minutes of mindful meditation prior to sleep. \\n*   Keep your smartphone or cell phone entirely out of the bedroom. Few people can drift off to sleep when they hear a notification signal. \\n*   Keep your room as quiet and dark as possible.

4de22db4-70f8-4ceb-8f65-0ac02fdc3525	LE - Parenting Tips for Law Enforcement - Following Instructions: Set the Situation 	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Following Instructions: Set the Situation** \\n\\n\\nAll parents want their children to do what they’re told, and to behave appropriately. While we’re wishing for things, we’d also like a million dollars. In reality, children’s natural tendencies sometimes make them unwilling – and sometimes unable, depending on their age – to always do what you would like them to. One of the best ways to help your children behave appropriately, and to listen when you ask them to do something, is to set up the situation so that your child has a strong probability of successful behavior. As you read on, it’s important to know an abundance of research shows children who have positive associations with following instructions and learning to do chores, are much less likely to argue or otherwise try to avoid them in the future.\\n\\nLet’s take an example. If 13-year-old Jessie comes home from school and immediately hears, “I need you to take out the trash, and pick up your room, and then do your homework,” it is very likely that at least one of these tasks will not be completed and may not even be remembered. As a teenager, it’s normal to want a break after school before starting homework. From the parent’s point of view, when one of the tasks isn’t completed a common experience is frustration or anger, which can escalate to demands or threats of punishment. The teen then feels resentful and angry that the good behavior wasn’t noticed, and that she was expected to remember and do everything right away. Episodes like these are not disasters, but when they occur repeatedly, they can impact relationships and develop into more serious conflicts.\\n\\nYou can help your child develop behaviors you want by setting up the situation for success. The basic approach is to break behaviors into smaller chunks, initially provide prompts and guidance combined with positive reinforcement, and then backing off as success is developed. This is similar to how many people learned to drive. First, their parent or instructor told or showed them step by step how to put the car in gear, when to press the gas, when to press the brake, and so on. With practice, these instructions became less frequent, until driving became independent.\\n\\n**Prompts**\\n\\nResearch on the most effective methods for getting children to follow directions shows calm, regular guidance improves parenting success. In practice, this involves setting up the situation with prompts. Prompts include verbal instructions (“Please brush your teeth now”), written reminders, or physical prompts, such as guiding the child in the behavior (e.g., guiding their hands while they tie their shoes). One of the leading experts in parenting research, Dr. Alan Kazdin, recommends giving instructions that are short, clear, and specific. He also found it helps to be near your child when giving the instruction, using a calm voice, and starting with “please.” For example, “Please put away your toys” was more effective that saying, “Put away your toys now.” When you first ask your child to start a new behavior, like washing the dishes, it can be helpful to prompt them by starting to do the task with them. Research shows combining the verbal prompt – “Please wash the dishes now” – with the prompt of physically assisting is more effective than either alone. Even better, Dr. Kazdin found that joining in the task (“Let’s start washing the dishes together”) helped children to be successful, and also decreased the likelihood of arguing about the task. While you may feel as though you shouldn’t have to help with chores your child is supposed to be responsible for, studies show fostering a guiding approach and loving relationship with your child is worth the extra 10 minutes for a few days to help them be successful learning tasks and helpful behaviors. Taking this small amount of extra time in the short run, saves time in the long run. \\n\\n**Setting Events**\\n\\nIn addition to prompts, setting events can affect behavior without using a specific instruction, can increase a child’s motivation to try something new, or help you with a task. For example, saying, “You probably can’t do this now because it’s too hard for children your age, but when you’re older you may be able to” can spark interest in the task, and make it a challenge. Children are usually more motivated to try the task and stick with it than if you simply told the child to do it. Parents of a child who resists dressing himself independently might stop arguing and pleading with him, and simply say, “It’s ok if you can’t dress yourself just yet. When you’re a bigger boy you’ll be able to.” The “bigger boy” phrase usually holds a special status for young boys. By backing off on their efforts to push their son into dressing himself, and linking independent dressing with something that “bigger boys” do, a child will become significantly more motivated to try dressing on his own. \\n\\n**Offer Choices**\\n\\nWhenever possible, offer choices in the way you phrase your requests. Children (and adults) don’t usually like being told what to do. But if they are asked to choose among two or more different tasks, they will feel much more independent, and less resistant to doing the task. For example, “Would you rather have your snack before or after you finish your homework?” or “You can brush your teeth first or take your bath first.” Although parents end up giving many instructions to their children over the years, they can reduce the sense of coercion by including choices as often as possible when giving these instructions. This also makes the child less likely to resist, as the child is actively choosing which activity to do. Ultimately, keep in mind you want your child to accurately perceive choices and become effective at executing a series of tasks. In the beginning, they have to learn through your guidance the steps involved in larger tasks (such as getting ready for bed) and develop confidence doing each step without you there.\\n\\nIt can be tempting to think that your children should be able to do what you ask them to do without any special guidance. This may be true, depending on their age. But would you rather have your child obey orders immediately, but feel resentful or distant from you; or have your relationship grow and deepen as you take the time to help and guide them to success? Most parents would choose the second option. Moreover, these strategies help officers remove the emotion from parenting and increase their child’s independent task completion. The great news is that, if you do follow the second option, your children will be more likely in the long run to develop and maintain positive behaviors – cleaning their room, completing homework, helping around the house – with less need for you to remind them to do so.\\n\\n**Key Points for Giving Instructions**\\n\\n**_Do These:_**\\n\\n*  Use a calm voice, and be specific about what you’re requesting.\\n*  Use the word “please” when making a request. It helps you soften the request from seeming like an order, and models good manners.\\n*  If possible, be physically close to your child to direct their attention and focus. It also prompts you to avoid using a loud voice.\\n*  Try to include choices that the child can choose from. Even if they all involve some sort of chore, the child still gets to exercise some independence in making the choice, and it’s a skill they need later in life.\\n\\n**_Avoid These:_**\\n\\n*  Avoid dramatic gestures like snapping your fingers or pointing your finger at the child.\\n*  Avoid saying, “because I said so,” to justify your request. Try to give instructions only once or twice calmly; avoid repeating the instructions several times in a short period (this is nagging, which is ineffective).\\n*  Resist the urge to describe what will happen if they don’t follow your instructions (e.g., “If you don’t study, you’ll never get into college”).", "title": "Following Instructions: Set the Situation ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:33:05.482838+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-26 13:05:06.186378+00	\N	f

You may be eligible for some or all of the benefits listed depending on the nature of your claim. If required you will be notified by the claims administrator, who is responsible for handling your claim, about your eligibility for benefits.   You may obtain all necessary claim forms [here](http://www.athensadmin.com/remif/), as well as instructions on how to submit a claim. Your supervisor will also be able to provide you with these forms, and they are available at City Hall 531, K Street, Eureka in the Human Resources Department. **Be sure to complete the [DWC1](http://www.athensadmin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DWC-1-2016.pdf) Form and submit to your supervisor or Human Resources in order to initiate a claim.** \\n\\nTo file a claim, complete the “Employee” section of the form, keep one copy and give the rest to your employer. Your employer will then complete the “Employer” section, give you a dated copy, keep one copy and send one to the claims administrator. Benefits can’t start until the claims administrator knows of the injury, so complete the form as soon as possible. \\n\\n_Medical Care_: Your claims administrator will pay all reasonable and necessary medical care for your work injury or illness. Medical benefits may include treatment by a doctor, hospital services, physical therapy, lab tests, x-rays, and medicines. Your claims administrator will pay the costs directly so you should never see a bill. There is a limit on some medical services. \\n\\nThe Primary Treating Physician (PTP) is the doctor with the overall responsibility for treatment of your injury or illness. Generally your employer selects the PTP you will see for the first 30 days, however, in specified conditions, you may be treated by your predesignated doctor or medical group. If a doctor says you still need treatment after 30 days, you may be able to switch to the doctor of your choice. Different rules apply if your employer is using a Health Care Organization (HCO) or a Medical Provider Network (MPN). A MPN is a selected network of health care providers to provide treatment to workers injured on the job. You should receive information from your employer if you are covered by an HCO or a MPN. Contact your employer for more information. If your employer has not put up a poster describing your rights to workers’ compensation, you may choose your own doctor immediately. \\n\\nWithin one working day after you file a claim form, your employer shall authorize the provision of all treatment, consistent with the applicable treating guidelines, for the alleged injury and shall continue to be liable for up to $10,000 in treatment until the claim is accepted or rejected. \\n\\n_Disclosure of Medical Records:_ After you make a claim for workers' compensation benefits, your medical records will not have the same level of privacy that you usually expect. If you don’t agree to voluntarily release medical records, a workers’ compensation judge may decide what records will be released. If you request privacy, the judge may \\"seal\\" (keep private) certain medical records. \\n\\n_Payment for Temporary Disability (Lost Wages)_: If you can't work while you are recovering from a job injury or illness, for most injuries you will receive temporary disability payments for a limited period of time. These payments may change or stop when your doctor says you are able to return to work. These benefits are tax-free. Temporary disability payments are two-thirds of your average weekly pay, within minimums and maximums set by state law. Payments are not made for the first three days you are off the job unless you are hospitalized overnight or cannot work for more than 14 days. \\n\\n_Return to Work_: To help you to return to work as soon as possible, you should actively communicate with your treating doctor, claims administrator, and employer about the kinds of work you can do while recovering. They may coordinate efforts to return you to modified duty or other work that is medically appropriate. This modified or other duty may be temporary or may be extended depending on the nature of your injury or illness. \\n\\n_Payment for Permanent Disability:_ If a doctor says your injury or illness results in a permanent disability, you may receive additional payments. The amount will depend on the type of injury, your age, occupation, and date of injury. \\n\\n_Supplemental Job Displacement Benefit (SJDB):_ If you were injured after 1/1/04 and you have a permanent disability that prevents you from returning to work within 60 days after your temporary disability ends, and your employer does not offer modified or alternative work, you may qualify for a nontransferable voucher payable to a school for retraining and/or skill enhancement. If you qualify, the claims administrator will pay the costs up to the maximum set by state law based on your percentage of permanent disability. \\n\\n_Death Benefits:_ If the injury or illness causes death, payments may be made to relatives or household members who were financially dependent on the deceased worker. It is illegal for your employer to punish or fire you for having a job injury or illness, for filing a claim, or testifying in another person's workers' compensation case (Labor Code 132a). If proven, you may receive lost wages, job reinstatement, increased benefits, and costs and expenses up to limits set by the state. \\n\\nYou have the right to disagree with decisions affecting your claim. If you have a disagreement, contact your claims administrator first to see if you can resolve it. If you are not receiving benefits, you may be able to get State Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits. Call State Employment Development Department at [(800) 480-3287](tel:8004803287). \\n\\nYou can obtain free information from an information and assistance officer of the State Division of Workers' Compensation (DWC), or you can hear recorded information and a list of local offices by calling [(800) 736-7401](tel:8007367401). You may also go to the DWC website at [www.dwc.ca.gov](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/). \\n\\nYou can consult with an attorney. Most attorneys offer one free consultation. If you decide to hire an attorney, his or her fee will be taken out of some of your benefits.

Extensive research with families identified two keys: punishment is not as effective as guidance; and, parents who rely primarily on punishment both worsen their relationship and don't get behavior change. Given these findings, this section describes how positive reinforcement can be used to promote things you want your child to do (sharing, completing chores), and decrease things you don't want them to do (fighting, throwing tantrums). We focus on three steps: Set Your Goal, Identify the Positive Opposite, and Break it Down. \\n\\n**Set Your Goals**\\n\\nBe concrete and describe what change you want to see. Asking your child to, \\"Be good\\" does not involve any specific behavior. However, \\"finish your homework\\" or setting a goal of making requests without whining are behaviors we can observe. Try to describe exactly what it would look like (either what they would be saying or doing). This gives a target that you can start to reinforce. \\n\\n**ID the Positive Opposite** \\n\\nTo move from punishing the behavior you don't want, to reinforcing what you do want, identify the positive opposite of what they're doing. \\n\\n**UNWANTED BEHAVIOR**\\n\\n*   Getting out of bed at night\\n*   Leaving dishes in the sink\\n*   Hitting siblings in the car\\n\\n**POSITIVE BEHAVIOR**\\n\\n*   Staying in bed with lights out\\n*   Putting dishes in the dishwasher\\n*   Keeping their hands to themselves\\n\\nResearch strongly demonstrates parents found great success reinforcing behaviors they did want that negative interactions about unwanted behavior. For behaviors you want them not to do, specify a behavior they can do that is incompatible with the undesirable behavior. This allows you to move your sights from punishing one behavior to reinforcing the \\"positive opposite\\" of that behavior. This means more chances for positive interactions with your children, more opportunities for your child to feel successful about changing their behavior, and greater success in actually changing the behavior, a win-win situation!\\n\\n**Break it Down**\\n\\nWhenever you have tasks that involve several steps, start with one or two manageable steps first, and build to the rest as the child becomes successful. \\"Getting ready for bed\\" might involve getting out pajamas, taking a bath, putting on pajamas, putting clothes in a hamper, brushing teeth, and getting into bed. If you start off by requesting all of this at once, it's unlikely they'll be completely successful. Instead, you can start off by asking them, \\"Please get your pajamas out,\\" the first couple of nights, and reinforcing them with praise when they do. Once the first action is well established, you can start adding the next step (\\"Please get your pajamas and then take your bath\\"), and provide reinforcement (such as praise or stickers; more on this later). \\n\\n**Set Your Expectations**\\n\\nAnother important point to make is that behavior change takes time, it is gradual, and children involve a consistent effort for anyone. For children, that consistent effort extends to their parents. The behavior change may take weeks, and there will likely be setbacks, when old behaviors (tantrums, etc.) reappear. Having realistic expectations will help you avoid feeling frustrated when these occur.

We've already discussed that by far the most effective way to help guide your child's behavior is through positive reinforcement of the desired behavior. One of the most powerful forms of positive reinforcement is completely free and readily available: your attention and your praise. Simply telling your child \\"Great job in putting your toys away!\\" or \\"I'm so proud of how you brushed your teeth the first time I asked!\\" is a very effective and valuable way to reinforce that behavior. When using praise as reinforcement, try to do it immediately after the behavior. You can even coax children towards the right behavior by reinforcing initial steps. In the case of a child who previously resisted brushing teeth, you can praise them as soon as they pick up the toothbrush, letting them know immediately that you are happy with their behavior. It's also important to say specifically what you are praising them for. Saying \\"You're so great!\\" doesn't indicate the behavior you are pleased about, but saying, \\"I really liked how you turned off the video game right when I asked you\\" gives specific details about the important behavior, and indicates exactly what they need to do next time to earn your praise.\\n\\n**Use Your Power Wisely**\\n\\nAttention is naturally reinforcing, and simply commenting on what your child is doing can encourage the behavior. For example, if you leave your child alone when they are playing quietly, they may begin doing things to draw your attention. This may include pulling the cat's tail, or drawing on the walls, or using profanity, even if it gets a negative reaction from you, the attention can still be reinforcing. For this reason, it's helpful to provide attention at times when your child is simply playing, drawing, or any \\"ok\\" activity that is not undesirable. This helps to reinforce these \\"good\\" and \\"ok\\" behaviors, making them occur more frequently than the undesirable behaviors you hope to discourage. \\n\\n**Reward Charts**\\n\\nWhen praise and attention are not reinforcing enough, parents can use a very simple point or chart system. Clearly specify the desired behavior (going to bed without protesting within one minute of being asked). Explain that he or she will be able to earn some fun treats or privileges, and that each time they do the target behavior, they will earn points towards the treat (if the child picks up toys after a parent asks him only one time, then he will earn 2 points, 6 points earns one grab bag treat). Position the chart where it's easy to see. Parents can purchase very low-cost toys, candies, and other treats or identify desired privileges (staying up 10 minutes extra, choosing what's for dinner, renting a movie, Mom or Dad taking them to the park) and write them on cards. Each time the child executes the behavior, you provide praise, and inform him that because he put away his toys he earned 2 points. Write the 2 points on his point chart together. When he has earned 6 points, express pride, show him on the chart how he has earned six points, and encourage him to redeem a treat. One of the most important components is simply making explicit to your child that they are being rewarded for their behavior, and consistently making this desired behavior something that receives attention and praise until it is established.  It is remarkable how quickly behaviors will increase when they are reinforced consistently with simple, low-cost or no-cost reinforcers such as attention, praise, and inexpensive treats. Some parents get caught in the trap of thinking, \\"I shouldn't have to reinforce my child to do what they're supposed to.\\" Unfortunately, this framing of the problem increases the parent's frustration and negative interactions with their child instead of working on the goal to improve behavior. Within a few weeks, you will be able to fade this reinforcement, and then let go of the point chart for that particular behavior. You will likely be able to maintain the behavior simply through periodically noticing and praising the behavior when you notice it. If the desired behavior begins to disappear for some reason, you can reinstate the point chart and increase your focus on reinforcing the behavior to bring it back.", "title": "Reinforcing Target Behaviors", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:34:11.153499+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:26:12.238098+00	\N	f
96d11a3b-4a9c-45e8-870f-ba5dc6e014c0	LE - Parenting Tips for Law Enforcement - Routines of Family Life	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Routines of Family Life**\\n\\n\\nEstablishing routines early with your family promotes stronger and deeper relationships, and will foster your child’s emotional and social well-being. These routines include establishing structure to the day, good communication, developing positive connections with family, strengthening appropriate social behaviors, and staying consistently aware of your child’s whereabouts. \\n\\n**Providing Structure**\\n\\nEstablishing everyday routines have an enormous impact on the emotional and social well-being of your children. Extensive research shows that having a set time and order for daily activities (chores, snack, dinner, homework, bath, reading, bedtime) creates a framework of safety and predictability for your children. Although they will continually ask you for opportunities to break from the framework (stay up late, skip chores), maintaining the framework actually leads to positive growth and development and children who don’t have the structure of daily routines achieve less, are more emotional, and more likely to have negative relationships. \\n\\n**Communicating with Your Children**\\n\\nAlthough parenting involves spending a lot of time providing guidance and boundaries for your children, one of the most rewarding parts of being a parent is deepening your relationship with your children over time. Establishing good communication early on will help you to become closer, and to protect your relationship when difficulties arise. Although many parents tell their children, “You can talk to me about anything,” Dr. Kazdin emphasizes it is more important to demonstrate this by your actions. This includes simply listening, thoughtfully and patiently, to your child’s ideas and opinions. To clarify what is meant by “listening,” I will quote Dr. Kazdin directly: “If you’re waiting for your child to stop talking so you can correct her misconceptions, that’s a pretty good definition of not listening.” Try simply taking in what your child is communicating, noticing what their experience is like. Set aside the impulse to correct or challenge what your child says – there is plenty of time for that – and simply listen to what the world looks like through their eyes. Asking your child to tell you more about their experiences, and letting them know that you are glad they shared with you. Part of communication involves you sharing as well. As you do so, try shifting the pattern from taking turns talking, to taking turns listening. \\n\\n**Strengthen Connections in the Family**\\n\\nDeveloping and following routines helps to make life more orderly and predictable, but family rituals help to make your family yours. This might include going to the park on Saturdays, a special breakfast on Sunday mornings, or board game nights once a month with the whole family. These activities don’t need to be exceptionally joyful or expensive. You can interact while taking care of weekly chores, taking pride in making contributions to an active and warm household. You can focus on activities that grow a storehouse of warm, affectionate memories with family members. Take a moment to think of what regular errands, task, or enjoyable activities you could easily schedule regularly with your children. This could be weekly grocery shopping, walking the dog, shooting hoops – or annual events, like planting flowers for the Spring, or raking leaves into a big pile. Following rituals and routines such as these creates a shared pool of memories that can help to connect and unify your family over the years. \\n\\n**Encourage Appropriate Social Behaviors**\\n\\nYou can help your child grow into a more effective and well-adjusted adult by looking for opportunities to strengthen positive social behaviors. This includes important skills such as playing nicely with other children, sharing, being sensitive to others, and cooperating with other children and adults. Many parents focus on developing their children’s academic or athletic skills – and these certainly are important. However, children who engage in more positive social behaviors are also more likely to do well in school, and to avoid behaviors that would get them into trouble. As a result, researchers are emphasizing the importance of developing positive social behaviors as preparation for succeeding in school, and later on in careers. As described in earlier sections, it is most helpful to give positive reinforcement when your child shows positive social behaviors. Reinforcing their practice of these behaviors will help strengthen them; making them more likely to continue to occur, and helping the child turn behaviors into regular habits.\\n\\nYour child will often show a combination of positive and negative behaviors in the same situation. When this occurs, try to reinforce the positive social behaviors by commenting – “You’re sharing with your friend” – or praising – “great job being so kind to your sister.” Look for chances to praise your child for the positive social behaviors (sharing, being supportive or encouraging, being considerate), even when they are mixed in with unwanted behaviors.\\n\\nIf you find that negative behaviors are occurring repeatedly, figure out what the positive opposite of that behavior would be, and reinforce this with praise. \\n\\n**Balance Consistency with Flexibility**\\n\\nFollowing a routine most of the time helps reduce uncertainty and unpredictability, which makes everyone generally calmer. Following routines must be balanced with a good dose of flexibility. Rigidly adhering to a routine at all costs, rather than bending the routine to allow for special circumstances, can introduce more tension. When trying to establish guidelines for positive family life, it is important to seek a “just right” balance between flexibility and boundaries. While it is important to establish and maintain high standards for your children’s behavior, it is also valuable for deepening your relationship that you listen attentively to your child’s perspective, and include this input in family decisions. Particularly for issues that will not be harmful, it can be helpful to compromise and allow requests that you may not prefer (e.g., dyed hair). Doing so gives more credibility and authority when you take a strong position on issues that involve long-term negative consequences (such as teen smoking). \\n\\n**Keep Track of Your Child’s Whereabouts**\\n\\nFinally, part of the family routine should involve monitoring your child’s whereabouts and activities. When parents know where their teenagers are, the teens are much less likely to use illegal drugs, engage in risky sexual behavior, or other potentially harmful behaviors. Monitoring includes knowing where your child is, who they are with, and what adult is in charge. It does not require that you check on them every 5 minutes or that you become a helicopter parent. Instead, it strikes a healthy balance between increasing independence for your child, with firm, consistent boundaries that keep them safe. \\n\\n**Summary of Family Life**\\n\\nYour years with your child will go by quickly. Make the most of your time with them by establishing simple but consistent family routines. This will help keep things predictable in the home, and will allow opportunities to store up an ever-growing bank of affectionate memories of shared family experiences. Remembering to take turns listening with your children that will ensure that you hear and appreciate their experiences, without reflexively waiting to correct or instruct them. And knowing where they are, and who they are with, will help them to avoid trouble and stay safe. It will also let them know how very important they are to you.", "title": "Routines of Family Life", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:35:41.345215+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:26:22.617922+00	\N	f

This intensity may be a rewarding part of the job for some, giving a sense of purpose and excitement while on the job. However, once the shift is over, this can be followed by a physical and mental letdown, as though all the energy has been drained away. Some may feel numb and lethargic for hours after being energized during their shift. Unfortunately, this letdown typically happens soon after work, when you arrive at home. Instead of returning from feeling alert and energetic back to normal, you might drop right past normal, all the way to feeling tired, indifferent, and unresponsive. This may lead family to wonder why you aren’t interacting with them. Children may wonder why mom or dad doesn’t want to play. If this goes on for long, family relationships may become remote or conflicted.\\n\\nYou can protect your family and yourself from the effects of the after-work letdown by first recognizing and understanding that it is occurring. Keep in mind that your job may be creating stress and excitement, and that this heightened physical arousal will be followed by a significant drop in energy. This will help you to anticipate feeling tired and even numb after work. Explaining this to your family can keep them from mistakenly assuming that you are not interested in the family. In addition, after anticipating the drop in energy, you can deliberately schedule a period of time to decompress, but also schedule specific times to interact fully with family. It is important to explicitly schedule times for these activities because when your energy drops after hours on the job, your natural state will be to remain passive (common behavioral examples of this state include flipping through channels, going online with no real purpose, or playing video games). Without setting specific times to take care of yourself and tend to your relationships with others, you could easily spend much of your off-duty time engaged in mindless activities.\\n\\nSo, as an important part of supporting your family, be sure to recognize if and when you are experiencing a pattern of major decrease in energy after getting off work. Be aware that this can cause you to tune out the people that you care about when you are at home, and then make a plan in advance to set times to pull yourself out of the low-energy fog, and engage with the people and activities that you value.", "title": "The After-Work Letdown", "coverUrl": "https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/408/817503/famsupport.jpg", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 12:50:51.588309+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 12:51:34.285499+00	\N	f

Although mental toughness may seem to come more naturally to some people, you can increase your mental toughness through deliberate practice. \\n\\nSTEP ONE: Getting Started\\n\\nYou can start to increase mental toughness by first taking stock accurately of your current strengths; this could be your ability to get along with others, physical agility, or technical knowledge. You can refer to these strengths regularly as a reminder of abilities you already possess. Next, list two or three areas where you have had some difficulties, like getting angry too easily at work, or worrying over and over about something you might have done differently. Next, review some of the concepts described above, and see how they might be useful. Are there negative thoughts that occur regularly that you could start to challenge, and replace with more accurate, helpful ways of thinking? When you start to have strong emotions that are interfering, could you become more aware of them, and list one or two useful actions you could take to manage the emotions? For example, you might notice that your heart starts beating faster and your jaw clenches when you become angry. You can rehearse in advance what adaptive steps you could take if this happens in the future, such as stepping briefly away from the situation, or practicing in advance a reminder to yourself to speak quietly and calmly. \\n\\nSTEP TWO: Strengthening Mental Toughness \\n\\nAfter identifying your current strengths and selecting areas you would like to strengthen, start tracking your target behaviors systematically. Keep a daily record of situations in which you were challenged to demonstrate mental toughness in ways that have been difficult for you, and rate yourself in terms of how well you handled the situation. Just as importantly, identify and write down in your tracking notes at least two effective ways of handling similar situations in the future. For example, if you found that you criticized yourself or became discouraged after a difficult situation, you can identify ways of thinking about the situation that you would find supportive and that would help you view the situation as a learning experience and keep your thinking positive and optimistic. After you identify effective ways of thinking or responding that would work well for you in the future, write these down in your tracking form, and review them briefly each day. \\n\\nSTEP THREE: Maintaining Mental Toughness\\n\\nOnce you have developed the habits of mental toughness, be sure to regularly tend to these habits to ensure that you keep them. Take a few minutes every few weeks to review and reflect on the characteristics of mental toughness, and see how closely your recent thoughts and actions have been aligned with the characteristics of mental toughness. If you find that some of these habits have weakened with time, it can be useful to review notes you may have kept as you worked toward developing mental toughness. \\n\\nKey Point: Finally, in keeping with the very first mental toughness concept: Persist! Keep at these efforts to increase your mental toughness, even if you have setbacks, or don't live up to your expectations. Learn from what doesn't work, and use it as a way to try new strategies that will work. Developing greater mental toughness will help you to be less negatively affected by difficult situations, and will help you to be more effective on the job and at home.", "title": "Three Steps to Increase Mental Toughness ", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 16:44:38.764923+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 16:44:38.764923+00	\N	f

To assist you with making these important decisions, CalPERS offers a variety of information on retirement topics at the links listed below. An employee considering retirement should begin planning at least one (1) year before the anticipated retirement date.\\n\\n**Service Retirement**  \\nService retirement is a lifetime benefit. You can retire as early as age 50 with five years of service credit unless all service was earned on or after January 1, 2013. Then you must be at least age 52 to retire. There are some exceptions to the 5-year requirement. If you are employed on a part-time basis and have worked at least five years, or you are also a member of a reciprocal retirement system, contact CalPERS to find out if an exception applies to you.\\n\\nUse the Retirement Planning Checklist to help prepare for retirement and find the documents needed to submit a complete application package.

Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, attending post-deployment reintegration briefings. FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered servicemember during a single 12-month period. A covered servicemember is: (1) a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness;\\\\* or (2) a veteran who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran, and who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness.\\\\*\\n\\n  \\n\\n_\\\\*The FMLA definitions of “serious injury or illness” for current servicemembers and veterans are distinct from the FMLA definition of “serious health condition”_\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Benefits and Protections**  \\n\\nDuring FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employee’s health coverage under any “group health plan” on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.\\n\\n  \\n\\nUse of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an employee’s leave.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n**Eligibility Requirements**\\n\\nEmployees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months, have 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months\\\\*, and if at least 50 employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles.\\n\\n  \\n\\n_\\\\*Special hours of service eligibility requirements apply to airline flight crew employees._\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Defition of Serious Health Condition**\\n\\nA serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities.\\n\\n  \\n\\nSubject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Use of Leave**  \\n\\nAn employee does not need to use this leave entitlement in one block. Leave can be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for planned medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the employer’s operations.

In order to use paid leave for FMLA leave, employees must comply with the employer’s normal paid leave policies.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Employee Responsibilities**   \\n\\nEmployees must provide 30 days advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 day’s notice is not possible, the employee must provide notice as soon as practicable and generally must comply with an employer’s normal call-in procedures.\\n\\n  \\n\\nEmployees must provide sufficient information for the employer to determine if the leave may qualify for FMLA protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Sufficient information may include that the employee is unable to perform job functions, the family member is unable to perform daily activities, the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health care provider, or circumstances supporting the need for military family leave. Employees also must inform the employer if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. Employees also may be required to provide a certification and periodic recertification supporting the need for leave.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Employer Responsibilities**  \\n\\nCovered employers must inform employees requesting leave whether they are eligible under FMLA. If they are, the notice must specify any additional information required as well as the employees’ rights and responsibilities. If they are not eligible, the employer must provide a reason for the ineligibility.\\n\\n  \\n\\nCovered employers must inform employees if leave will be designated as FMLA-protected and the amount of leave counted against the employee’s leave entitlement. If the employer determines that the leave is not FMLA-protected, the employer must notify the employee.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Unlawful Acts by Employers**\\n\\nFMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:\\n\\n*   Interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under FMLA; and  \\n      \\n    \\n*   Discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA.\\n    \\n\\n**Enforcement**  \\nAn employee may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or may bring a private lawsuit against an employer.  \\n\\nFMLA does not affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave rights.  \\n\\nFMLA section 109 (29 U.S.C. § 2619) requires FMLA covered employers to post the text of this notice. \\n\\n  \\n\\nRegulation 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(a) may require additional disclosures.\\n\\n  \\n\\n**For Additional Information:**\\n\\n(866) 4US-WAGE: [(866)-487-9243](tel:8664879243), TTY: (877) 889-5627\\n\\n  \\n\\n[www.wagehour.dol.gov](https://www.dol.gov/whd/)\\n\\n  \\n\\nU.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division           \\n\\nWHD Publication 1420          Revised February 2013", "title": "Family and Medical Leave "}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-25 15:59:30.321089+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-25 15:59:30.321089+00	\N	f

For example, describing an event by saying, \\"I completely froze, and people died because I was a coward,\\" involves conclusions and value judgments that are not at all objective. An objective description of the event might be, \\"I saw the (emergency situation) and started trying to make sense of what was happening. For several seconds I was unsure what action to take, and in that time period, the (emergency situation) worsened and people died before I was able to act. I later recognized what I could have done, but by that time it was too late.\\" This second description is more objective, and takes into account the realities of being human and impossibility of knowing in every moment the best action to take. \\n\\nDescribing the event objectively and neutrally offers some emotional distance. There is a benefit to reviewing the event in terms of the different factors that led to the event occurring, and trying to understand the actions of people involved. This processing of the event should also take into account the previous experiences of the people involved. Consider an officer who previously held his fire when confronting a suspect in a darkened environment. The suspect then fired, striking the officer's partner. This officer's history now includes the very significant and painful memory of having his officer shot when the officer decided not to fire on a suspect. In the future, if this officer experienced the morally injurious event of firing on an unarmed suspect, this previous history of harmful consequences from not firing would be important in healing from this event, because it helps to explain the officer's later decision to fire more readily. Similarly, some military personnel have reported becoming excessively forceful and, in some cases, continuing to shoot at surrendering enemy combatants. If no other information was available, one might conclude that they were sadistic or intentionally cruel. However, some soldiers have had the experience of becoming hyper-aggressive after \\"freezing\\" in their initial contacts with the enemy. One soldier froze in his first firefight, and witnessed his buddy being fatally shot by the enemy while he was unable to react with protective fire. The soldier felt intense shame for what he perceived as his own cowardice, and attempted to compensate for it by making sure to open fire any time he thought he detected an enemy. As a result, he ended up shooting at not only active enemy fighters, but also at surrendering or wounded enemies, as well as unarmed civilians. As you can see, his effort to make up for his earlier inaction caused him to engage in acts that violated moral standards; however, the soldier did not intend to behave immorally. The reason this is important is that we can sometimes make sense of actions when we get a fuller and more detailed picture of all of the factors that led up to a moral injury event.", "title": "Processing Moral Injury", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:02:08.546459+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:18:10.291862+00	\N	f

They don’t give up.\\n\\n**Key 2: High Self-Expectations**\\n\\nMental toughness only grows when you test the bounds of your comfort zone. Mentally tough people set high standards for their performance, and consistently aim to meet these standards.\\n\\n**Key 3: Support-Seeking**\\n\\nBecoming mentally tough involves recognizing when you may lack a piece of information, or a skill that is needed to perform at a high level, and being willing to ask others who can provide the information or guidance to improve performance. This can also involve seeking guidance in effectively handling difficult emotions that might interfere with performance, or directly seeking emotional support.\\n\\nKey Point: The purpose of support-seeking in mental toughness is to be willing to ask for whatever help may be needed in order to maintain high standards of performance.\\n\\n**Key 4: Personal Responsibility**\\n\\nThis includes recognizing what you need to do to perform at your best, and taking active steps to remain fit and focused. It also involves being proactive in identifying skills or abilities you may need, or problems that may be developing in the workplace, so that you can quickly address them without allowing them to interfere with job performance.\\n\\n**Key 5: Self-Belief and Optimistic Thinking**\\n\\nDeveloping mental toughness involves strengthening your belief in your own capabilities. It also involves expecting positive outcomes, and, when things don’t go as planned, taking action to improve the situation, rather than giving up. Self-belief and optimism can be developed with practice, such as making a realistic list of your strengths and skills, and reviewing these daily. A more optimistic view can be developed by identifying situations when you feel discouraged or frustrated, and then notice whether your thoughts may be inaccurately negative. You can then identify more accurate and helpful ways of thinking about the situation, and can practice using these new ways of thinking.\\n\\n**Key 6: Heightened Emotional Awareness**\\n\\nBeing mentally tough requires understanding yourself well enough to anticipate what situations will trigger which emotions, and learning how to effectively manage your emotions so that they do not interfere with your effectiveness in difficult situations. This heightened emotional awareness also gives you an opportunity to understand the behavior of other people, allowing you to interact more effectively with them.\\n\\n**Key 7: Experience in Overcoming Hardship**\\n\\nMental toughness increases when the right mindset encounters a challenging obstacle. For athletes, this may involve difficult rehabilitation after an injury. For correctional officers and correctional staff, this may include getting back to work after making an error on the job, or after processing the scene of a large riot. Mental toughness involves being fully aware of difficult emotions, and skillfully managing these emotions so that you can take effective actions and make sound decisions on the job. \\n\\nEach time hardships are encountered, you can learn more clearly how you tend to react, and what helps you to manage your emotions and behaviors appropriately. By practicing self-awareness, you can become more effective in handling difficult situations, and increase your mental toughness.", "title": "Seven Key Characteristics of Mental Toughness", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 16:43:14.268361+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 16:43:14.268361+00	\N	f

This injustice gap creates a persistent sense that there is something wrong in the world, causing unease, and preventing feelings of peace. Addressing this injustice gap involves identifying what needs to occur to make things right again, and taking actions that can realistically accomplish this goal. Of course, some wrongs can never be fully righted, and it is necessary to recognize when a wrong that you witnessed cannot be undone; or when the consequences of your own harmful actions cannot be corrected. If you have done what you can to make amends for a wrong you may have done, but continue to experience distress over the event, there are additional steps that promote moral healing.

Trying to explain away such events as \\"mistakes\\" is ineffective when someone chose, for whatever reason, to do something that they knew was wrong. \\n\\nIf someone in a position of authority did something morally wrong, and this has been burdening you with anger, contempt, or cynicism, it can be useful to simply acknowledge the fact that this event occurred, and to accept this reality. This does not mean that you agree with the action, or dismiss it or say \\"no big deal.\\" Instead, this involves accepting the reality that, in the world we live in, people at times do things that are morally wrong. This acceptance can be helpful because some people will brood and stew over a perceived wrong, as if the sense of injustice would eat at them until the moral wrong was made right. Acknowledging and accepting this \\"someone in authority did something morally wrong, and it cannot be undone\\" can allow the toxic feelings of anger and contempt over the injustice to fade away. \\n\\nThe same applies if you have been distressed by something that you did that violated your moral values; acknowledging and accepting the reality that you did something against your moral values causes you to make the reality an explicit part of history. Some people struggle daily with guilt and shame, and try in one way or another to \\"undo\\" the moral violation, sometimes by punishing themselves or cutting themselves off from others. While these actions create misery for the person and their loved ones, they cannot undo the moral violation itself. By acknowledging and accepting the reality of having violated your moral values, you can move towards forgiving yourself as a person who did something they regret. \\n\\nIn fact, an important part of healing from moral injury involves accepting the reality that moral violations being committed by oneself and by others makes up a part (although usually a very small part) of being human. Languages around the world incorporate a term for \\"forgiveness\\" precisely because humans, at one time or another, commit acts that they should not have committed. Fortunately, our stories do not stop when we do something wrong, and we all have the potential to move forward from moral injuries. How does one move forward after an act that causes moral injury? By moving towards forgiveness, and by moving toward our values.", "title": "Accepting the Reality of a Moral Violation", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:02:39.981118+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:18:15.500746+00	\N	f

Active coping would include recognizing aspects of the job that are causing dissatisfaction, such as problems with other officers or supervisors, or problems at home including practical or interpersonal issues. Once problems are clearly recognized, they can be dealt with actively and effectively. For example, some officers may be reluctant to admit problems in handling a work-related issue. However, if the problem persists, dissatisfaction and burnout may develop. An active coping approach could include seeking mentoring by a more experienced officer or supervisor, or consulting with fellow officers or supervisors who may have useful experience or insight. Active coping could also include discussing with family members problem issues that may be causing distress at home or at work and working cooperatively toward a solution that improves the situation.

4dbc0697-4780-4a2a-bd73-836604a6eaf3	LE - Mindfulness - Overview	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Overview**\\n\\n\\n\\n**_Mindfulness_** refers to a non-judgmental awareness that arises as we intentionally allow ourselves to observe and take in the unfolding of experience in each moment, as it happens, and just the way that it is. Unpacking these ideas, we find that mindfulness includes **_non-reactivity to inner experience_**, such that we can perceive thoughts, emotions, and sensations, without having to react in a knee-jerk (or \\"mindless\\") way. Mindfulness involves experiencing events directly, without the seemingly constant stream of internal chatter and commentary that our minds produce. Rather, the emphasis is on taking in the experience of sensations, emotions, and other aspects of the world without judging or wishing that things were in any way different from how they currently are.  \\n  \\nBeing mindful includes being **_attentive_** to sensations, to surroundings, to words, and to one's mental events as they are occurring, rather than distracted by future plans or past events (and so \\"mindless\\" of one's immediate experience). This involves the ability to **_observe_** one's sensations or emotions and **_remain present_** with these experiences, even when they are uncomfortable or painful.  \\n  \\nMindfulness involves **_acting with awareness_** and being fully engaged in the moment, whether this involves listening to a friend, going for a walk, or being in an argument. The opposite of acting with awareness is being distracted, careless, and operating on automatic pilot, and this is associated with not being fully engaged and alive in the present moment ourselves, and may lead those around us to feel ignored or misunderstood.  \\n  \\nBeing **_non-judgmental of experience_** means that we do not criticize ourselves for the thoughts, reactions, or emotions we may experience, but rather accept these occurrences as they are. It has been noted that much distress arises because we tend to wish that things were different, either within ourselves, in others, or the world; and we tend to increase our distress as we criticize, judge, resent, or otherwise demand that the present reality be different from the way that it is. The practice of mindfulness includes observing when we are having such thoughts, and then calmly, and with self-compassion, giving such thoughts a label such as \\"judging\\" or \\"criticizing,\\" and then observing with curiosity as these thoughts fade from our mind, just as clouds float by and disappear. With this non-judging stance, sensations and emotions, even those that may be uncomfortable or painful, are noted, experienced, and accepted, without avoiding or attempting to change them. For many, the experience of stepping back from the struggle against negative emotions or physical discomfort can be freeing, replaced by acceptance of events as they are.  \\n  \\nThis is not to suggest that practicing mindfulness results in the end of our worries, self-critical comments, or daydreaming about the future. Rather, through the practice of mindfulness, we learn to view such thoughts as simply mental events that the mind produces, and not necessarily true statements. Rather than becoming wrapped up by such thoughts and identifying closely with them, mindfulness practices help us to take a step back, distancing ourselves from our thoughts, and simply non-judgmentally allowing these thoughts to pass across our mind as clouds pass across the sky.", "title": "Overview", "summary": "", "videoUrl": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/217912401", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:08:30.830362+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-26 12:55:26.980136+00	\N	f

65d0a837-1ae1-4a00-9038-fe1d06ddc213	LE - Mindfulness - Mindfulness Exercises	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Mindfulness Exercises**\\n\\n\\nThe regular practice of mindfulness exercises trains us to bring our attention back, again and again, to the full experience of the present moment, and doing so in a way that is accepting, inviting, and non-judging, experiencing events as they are without attempting to change, control, criticize, deny, or distract from them. To the extent that we can experience the full range of sensations and emotions without attempting to distract from them, we can become more fully engaged in our lives, and can more deeply and authentically interact and engage with others, with our jobs, and with the activities and goals that are meaningful to us.\\n\\n**Mindful Breathing**\\n\\nBefore attempting to extend mindfulness to all aspects of your life, it is helpful to begin practicing with an experience that is emotionally neutral. Sitting comfortably, this exercise involves drawing your attention to the sensations of your breath, noting the feelings at the nostrils, or in the belly, as the breath enters, then leaves the body. Without attempting to control the action or pace of breathing, simply rest in awareness of the feeling of your breathing as it occurs. As your mind produces thoughts that draw you away from awareness of the breath (and it will do so almost constantly), simply notice that your attention has wandered, and then gently, and with deep kindness and self-compassion, escort your attention back to the sensations of the breath. If your mind produces thoughts such as, “I keep messing up – I’m not doing it right!” or, “I really need to get started on that project,” simply notice the thoughts, accept that they have occurred, and give a mental label such as “worrying” or “planning.” Then, with kindness and self-compassion, allow these thoughts to drift through and out of your awareness, returning your attention once again, over and over, to the sensations of the breath.\\n\\nMost people start with approximately 10 minutes of practice with this activity. As this may be the first mindfulness exercise you have tried, it is important to emphasize that the goal is not to avoid being distracted by thoughts, but rather to notice over and over when you have become distracted, and to gently escort your attention back to the breath, over and over. If you become distracted a thousand times while practicing mindful breathing, then with self-compassion and kindness, return your attention to the breath a thousand times. The repetition of guiding one’s attention, and of offering self-compassion each time, helps one to acquire and strengthen the habits of mindfulness so that they can be introduced into one’s daily life.\\n\\nAn audio-guided mindful breathing exercise can be found [here](http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/01_Breathing_Meditation.mp3).\\n\\n**Mindful Walking**\\n\\nAs you prepare to begin walking, notice your posture, and the position of your shoulders, neck, legs, and feet. Allow your knees to be softly flexed, and your arms to fall loosely to the sides. With a soft gaze directed ahead, draw your attention to the sensations of your feet in their shoes as they contact the ground, noting how your feet support your weight. As you begin walking slowly, notice the sensations in your leg as it pushes off the ground, the toes moving against the surface, and the other foot rising, gliding forward, and making contact again with the surface. Note the shifting of weight as it transmits through the feet, the legs, the re-balancing of weight in the back muscles, and the arms repositioning.\\n\\nAs you walk several paces, expand your awareness to take in sensations of breathing, the feel of the breeze across your skin, the sounds that your clothes may make as you move, the sounds of your shoes contacting the surface. When your mind begins to produce thoughts, or starts to wander, notice where it has gone or what thoughts it has produced, and then, with kindness and self-compassion, gently escort your attention back to the sensations and immediate experiences of walking.\\n\\nAn audio-guided mindful walking exercise can be found [here](https://soundcloud.com/jack-kornfield/walking-meditation).\\n\\n**Mindful Eating**\\n\\nStart with a single item of food, of any type. Take in through your fingers the surface texture, heft, and shape of the food. Note how it feels in your hand, the smoothness or roughness, coolness or warmth. Take in the image of the food visually; what colors emerge? What shapes, curves, or edges are present? As you bring the food to your mouth, what aromas do you detect? Are more than one different types of smell present? Rather than judging or evaluating these sensations, simply observe them, taking them in as they are. \\n\\nWith the first bite of the food, take your time to allow the different textural sensations to arise, spread throughout your mouth, across your tongue and against your teeth. Observe the tastes that emerge, and note how they may change from moment to moment, some flavors fading, others emerging. Pause while chewing, and experience the tactile sensations, taste, and aroma of the food, and then note the sound and sensation as you swallow the food.\\n\\nAn audio-guided mindful eating exercise is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzMaYXC56Ug&feature=youtu.be).\\n\\n**Mindful Morning Routine**\\n\\nAs you become familiar with the practice of mindfulness during different activities, you may wish to extend mindfulness into many of your daily experiences. Developing a mindful morning routine can help to start the day with greater focus, peace, and clarity of thought, and can promote the practice of mindfulness during subsequent activities. A useful first step in setting a mindful morning routine actually begins before going to bed, by preparing for the mindful morning activities. First, ensure that you have a comfortable, uncluttered space to sit or lie down the next morning. If you listen to an audio-guided script, have the equipment set up, with earbuds on hand if needed. Set your alarm clock to allow you sufficient time for meditation, any physical movement exercises you might wish to do, and the rest of your regular morning tasks, without excessive rushing.\\n\\nIf you plan to wake earlier than typical, it is very common to hit the snooze button, turn off the alarm, or otherwise remain in bed. A simple but effective strategy to counter this is to rehearse, after you get in bed, how you will respond to the earlier alarm. Mentally rehearse the process of hearing the alarm, turning it off, sitting up and setting your feet on the floor, then standing. If you find waking early especially difficult, try actually practicing the physical movements of getting out of bed to strengthen this rehearsal. Before sleep, remind yourself of your intention to arise with the alarm clock to start your mindful morning routine.\\n\\nNext, go to your place of meditation, sitting quietly and then beginning the meditation, either guided by audio or self-directed. With time you may wish to vary the nature of the meditation exercise, but breathing meditation is a perfect way to begin. At the conclusion of the meditation time, it may be useful to take a few moments for gentle physical movement, either a stretching exercise, yoga, or a cardiovascular exercise routine. During these activities, continue to notice and observe the sensations, thoughts, and emotions that may arise in a curious, kind, and non-judgmental way. As you transition to showering, dressing, eating breakfast, and other activities, open your senses to the sounds of the water splashing, the sensation of the towel against skin, the texture of breakfast between the teeth, and colors of fabrics and surfaces around you. As you prepare to leave home, remind yourself to return again and again throughout the day to moment-by-moment experiences, just as they occur, with an open heart, with curiosity, and with kindness to yourself and others.", "title": "Mindfulness Exercises", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:09:26.87803+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:15:15.293031+00	\N	f

The nature of policing places law enforcement officers in situations where trauma is unavoidable, chronic stress and post-traumatic stress are the norm, and suicide, depression, risky behavior, obesity, anxiety and addiction are dangerously potential health outcomes. In addition to these incident-based stressors, it is no secret that organizational stressors also negatively impact officer wellness. This constant exposure to stress exacts a heavy toll on police personnel and their families.\\n\\nHistorically we have responded to this stress and trauma through the construct of Critical Incident Stress Debriefing, Peer Support, and Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). In essence, we have been acknowledging that our personnel experience stress and trauma, but we wait to intervene until post incident. Little consideration is given to neurobiology and other scientific disciplines that demonstrate how stress and trauma significantly impact the human behind the badge.\\n\\n**New Challenges, Opportunities**\\n  \\nEvery year it seems that more and more responsibility to solve society’s ills falls on the shoulders of our front-line law enforcement officers. We are dealing with homelessness and mental illness in ways we never have before. We continue to throw new training at law enforcement officers: We teach them how to administer a drug; how to identify mental illness on the spectrum of mental health conditions; we give them resources to help people who are homeless; we train them in complex crimes such as robbery, sex assault, domestic violence, fraud and homicide.\\n\\nAs we overload our law enforcement officers with training, expecting them to become impromptu mental health experts, victim and family advocates, paramedics and heroes, we are doing so – knowing full well – that they are encountering trauma and suffering. Science informs us that learning to pay attention to your mind and body is a critical resilience and performance skill, and mindfulness meditation is the path towards obtaining that goal. It is time to take care of the human behind the badge.\\n\\nStressful events trigger hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, that increase heartbeat, blood circulation, and mobilization of fat and sugar, that race through the body, as the mind focuses attention and prepares muscles for action. This is often called the “flight-or-fight” response, and it happens in an instant. In the short term, stress may not have such a negative impact on performance because it can help focus our attention and expedite our response. However, in the long term, continuous exposure to stressful events, without training to mitigate that stress, leads to some form(s) of negative mind/body consequence, such as higher risk of cardiac death (Innerman, 2012), higher rates of depression (Wang et al., 2010), PTSD (Marmat et al., 2006) and alcohol use disorders (Rees & Smith, 2008), and let’s not forget forfeiting at least seven years off your lifespan (Violanti, 1996).\\n\\nRecovering from a stress response requires additional time that is rarely available in our current operational paradigm. What we fail to teach police officers is that a constant state of hypervigilance is not sustainable, harms cognitive performance, and ultimately creates negative health consequences that will shorten or drastically reduce the quality of their lives – likely both. It should be no surprise that our health and psychological profiles are some of the worst of any profession.\\n\\nIt might be accurate to say that police officers learn early on in their careers to bury their emotions. In police work, calming down the body and regulating the activity of the mind, as well as the emotional being, is rarely part of the officer’s conscious consideration. We are trained to believe that being hypervigilant at all times is imperative to our safety, is a positive behavior, and crafting a suit of cultural armor is a way of being. This non-sustainable hypervigilance mindset demands extreme sensory awareness to environmental triggers and relies deeply on heuristics influenced by our stress response (Kahneman 2001).  \\n\\nOne doesn’t have to be a scientist or a physician to understand how damaging this is to one’s well-being and sense of self. The result is a reduction in the ability to fully interpret our environment and process new information. Reacting versus responding to the stimuli in any situation, perceiving every encounter as a potential lethal interaction, inhibits our ability to make sound decisions under stress. \\n\\n**A Better Approach**\\n  \\nThe health profile of police officers and first responders clearly informs us that our traditional approach to wellness is not working. Science informs us that perhaps we should consider a nontraditional approach to increase well-being and foster resiliency. \\n\\nResiliency allows us to navigate through the stress and trauma of our work with either no negative effects, or with increased emotional stability, psychological strength, and personal growth. It really is simply the ability of a person to bounce back from a stressful event or a traumatic experience unscathed. Science today informs us that mindfulness training helps to achieve that goal. \\n\\n“Mindfulness changes how the officer is aware of himself, how they manage and lead themselves,” says Lt. Richard Goerling, “and it opens up an awareness and compassion that radically changes how they show up, so it changes the energy of the encounter.”\\n\\nResearch continues to consistently show that mindfulness meditation addresses the need for first responders to build individual resilience, so officers can increase their capacity to skillfully navigate occupational stress and trauma. While mindfulness is relatively new to law enforcement, it is not new to the military and other elite performance populations, having been introduced to the U.S. Army Special Forces in the 1980s (Strozzi-Heckler, 1995) and the U.S. Marines in 2006 (Stanley, et al., 2008).  Pacific University has found promising results associated with managing stress, strengthening attention, improving emotion regulation, reducing anger and aggression, and reducing alcohol use (Christopher et al, 2014).  \\n\\nMindfulness is not about being all \\"Zen\\" and compromising tactical safety. In fact. it is quite the opposite: it actually improves our tactics. In Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (MBRT), officers learn that emotions are not optional, emotions happen, and are normal.\\n\\nAnd if mindfulness enhances emotional regulation, and stress is regulated, officers can assess their environment and external stimuli more effectively, resulting in more effective cognitive decisions along with enhanced performance and officer safety.  \\n\\nAs Lt. Goerling says, “Mindfulness in policing is about transformation – transformation of the individual officer who is suffering deeply as a result of trauma, transformation of the organization and its leaders impacted by the slow toxicity of occupational and organizational stressors, and transformation of our capacity to build community.”\\n\\nA mindful practice does not have to be hours of meditation each day. Taking just five minutes during your day can have a positive impact on your ability to be resilient. Sitting, standing, and walking are all modes of mindfulness meditation. A breathing focused meditation is very easy to do. It involves focusing our attention on the inhale and exhale of the breath. When the mind wanders, we simple return our focus to the breath. This kind of meditation develops the skill to interact with the constant stream of our thoughts, while also changing our relationship with our thoughts. \\n\\nScience informs us that when our minds wander, our thoughts are mostly negative in nature approximately 47% of the time, (Killingsworth et al, 2010). Not only that, they are self-referential. This means that we have a constant flow of thoughts that tell us negative stories in which we are the main character.  \\n\\nWith a mindfulness practice, rather than allowing our thoughts to control us, by returning our focus to the breath, we are interrupting that process and reducing the flow of negative thoughts. The neuroplasticity of the brain is dependent upon experience, and the practice of mindfulness alters the experience of your thoughts. The brain is continually remodeling itself. Neurons are continually firing every second, which means that if you only spend five minutes doing mindfulness meditation, you are creating new neural pathways and growing your resilience and sense of well-being. \\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n  \\nHow awesome would it be to journey through the hurricane of life and not let it blow you over? How awesome would it be to come to work every day capable of moving through stress and trauma, and ending your shift without tension, or a sense of suffering, but with a sense of well-being, and pride in the human behind the badge?\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTejada, Jennifer, Chief of Police and Mindfulness Peer Coach, _Be Fit_ _– Be Well –_ _Be More._\\n\\nViolanti, J., Campbell, D., (2017). _Building Resilience: A Protective Leadership Strategy for Increasing Performance_.

In addition, the more severe traumatic stressors that correctional officers and correctional staff experience can lead to intrusive memories of events, difficulty sleeping, feelings of detachment or disconnection from others, feelings of being on edge and watchful, and other negative emotions. These difficult emotions can easily affect those around you. Family members may wonder why you seem irritated or quick to anger. They may feel excluded, if you find yourself disengaging and becoming isolated. If you find yourself carrying around negative emotions such as these, take this as a signal first to check in with yourself, identifying how long these emotions have been present and what events or thoughts may have triggered them. Next, check in with your family members to see if they have noticed your difficult emotions, and how they may have been affected. For example, if you have been irritable, they may have thought that they had done something wrong; while if you have been disengaged, they may have thought that you no longer enjoy being with them. It can be helpful to clarify with them that you have been having some difficult emotions because of events at work, and reinforce to them the strength of your love and commitment to them.

However, the evidence for such claims is exceedingly sparse. Most commercially available supplements have shown little or no improvement on measured cognitive performance, or on brain imaging studies. Regular use of fish oil supplements was associated in one study with both improved cognitive performance and less age-related loss of brain volume over a several-year period. However, several other studies of shorter duration did not find such benefits from taking fish oil supplements. A number of studies have investigated the effects of multivitamins, Omega-3 fatty acids, and herbal supplements. While the results of studies tend to be mixed, the typical finding is that the most rigorous experiments find little to no benefit from using any of these products for improving cognitive performance or brain health. In other words, it is probably best to simply follow a healthy diet, and not spend your money on supplements with little or no evidence of effectiveness. \\n\\n**Healthy Diet**\\n\\nAlthough no specific diet has been identified that will ensure you will never develop cognitive decline or dementia, one well-known dietary approach with evidence for cognitive health is the Mediterranean diet.

Dairy products such as cheese are less frequent in Mediterranean diets, and red meat is eaten less frequently. \\n\\nAt least one study showed that adding elements of the Mediterranean diet appeared to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease compared to regular eating habits.

Moreover, even modest adoption of the MIND diet approach, such as eating two vegetable servings a day, two berry servings a week, and one fish meal a week, appeared to lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

They don't give up.\\n\\n**Key 2: High Self-Expectations**\\n\\nMental toughness only grows when you test the bounds of your comfort zone. Mentally tough people set high standards for their performance, and consistently aim to meet these standards.\\n\\n**Key 3: Support-Seeking**\\n\\nBecoming mentally tough involves recognizing when you may lack a piece of information, or a skill that is needed to perform at a high level, and being willing to ask others who can provide the information or guidance to improve performance. This can also involve seeking guidance in effectively handling difficult emotions that might interfere with performance, or directly seeking emotional support.\\n\\nKey Point: The purpose of support-seeking in mental toughness is to be willing to ask for whatever help may be needed in order to maintain high standards of performance. \\n\\n**Key 4: Personal Responsibility**\\n\\nThis includes recognizing what you need to do to perform at your best, and taking active steps to remain fit and focused. It also involves being proactive in identifying skills or abilities you may need, or problems that may be developing in the workplace, so that you can quickly address them without allowing them to interfere with job performance. \\n\\n**Key 5: Self-Belief and Optimistic Thinking**\\n\\nDeveloping mental toughness involves strengthening your belief in your own capabilities. It also involves expecting positive outcomes, and, when things don't go as planned, taking action to improve the situation, rather than giving up. Self-belief and optimism can be developed with practice, such as making a realistic list of your strengths and skills, and reviewing these daily. A more optimistic view can be developed by identifying situations when you feel discouraged or frustrated, and then notice whether your thoughts may be inaccurately negative. You can then identify more accurate and helpful ways of thinking about the situation, and can practice using these new ways of thinking. \\n\\n**Key 6: Heightened Emotional Awareness** \\n\\nBeing mentally tough requires understanding yourself well enough to anticipate what situations will trigger which emotions, and learning how to effectively manage your emotions so that they do not interfere with your effectiveness in difficult situations. This heightened emotional awareness also gives you an opportunity to understand the behavior of other people, allowing you to interact more effectively with them. \\n\\n**Key 7: Experience in Overcoming Hardship** \\n\\nMental toughness increases when the right mindset encounters a challenging obstacle. For athletes, this may involve difficult rehabilitation after an injury. For first responders, this may include getting back to work after making an error on the job, or after working at a scene involving fatalities. Mental toughness involves being fully aware of difficult emotions, and skillfully managing these emotions so that you can take effective actions and make sound decisions on the job. Each time hardships are encountered, you can learn more clearly how you tend to react, and what helps you to manage your emotions and behaviors appropriately. By practicing self-awareness, you can become more effective in handling difficult situations, and increase your mental toughness.", "title": "Seven Key Characteristics of Mental Toughness", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:20:49.708161+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:13:16.519171+00	\N	f

Although mental toughness may seem to come more naturally to some people, you can increase your mental toughness through deliberate practice. \\n\\n**STEP ONE: Getting Started**\\n\\nYou can start to increase mental toughness by first taking stock accurately of your current strengths; this could be your ability to get along with others, physical agility, or technical knowledge. You can refer to these strengths regularly as a reminder of abilities you already possess. Next, list two or three areas where you have had some difficulties, like getting angry too easily at work, or worrying over and over about something you might have done differently. Next, review some of the concepts described above, and see how they might be useful. Are there negative thoughts that occur regularly that you could start to challenge, and replace with more accurate, helpful ways of thinking? When you start to have strong emotions that are interfering, could you become more aware of them, and list one or two useful actions you could take to manage the emotions? For example, you might notice that your heart starts beating faster and your jaw clenches when you become angry. You can rehearse in advance what adaptive steps you could take if this happens in the future, such as stepping briefly away from the situation, or practicing in advance a reminder to yourself to speak quietly and calmly. \\n\\n**STEP TWO: Strengthening Mental Toughness** \\n\\nAfter identifying your current strengths and selecting areas you would like to strengthen, start tracking your target behaviors systematically. Keep a daily record of situations in which you were challenged to demonstrate mental toughness in ways that have been difficult for you, and rate yourself in terms of how well you handled the situation. Just as importantly, identify and write down in your tracking notes at least two effective ways of handling similar situations in the future. For example, if you found that you criticized yourself or became discouraged after a difficult situation, you can identify ways of thinking about the situation that you would find supportive and that would help you view the situation as a learning experience and keep your thinking positive and optimistic. After you identify effective ways of thinking or responding that would work well for you in the future, write these down in your tracking form, and review them briefly each day. \\n\\n**STEP THREE: Maintaining Mental Toughness**\\n\\nOnce you have developed the habits of mental toughness, be sure to regularly tend to these habits to ensure that you keep them. Take a few minutes every few weeks to review and reflect on the characteristics of mental toughness, and see how closely your recent thoughts and actions have been aligned with the characteristics of mental toughness. If you find that some of these habits have weakened with time, it can be useful to review notes you may have kept as you worked toward developing mental toughness. \\n\\n**Key Point:** Finally, in keeping with the very first mental toughness concept: Persist! Keep at these efforts to increase your mental toughness, even if you have setbacks, or don't live up to your expectations. Learn from what doesn't work, and use it as a way to try new strategies that will work. Developing greater mental toughness will help you to be less negatively affected by difficult situations, and will help you to be more effective on the job and at home.", "title": "Three Steps to Increase Mental Toughness", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:21:28.97134+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:13:22.207977+00	\N	f

7bc0a2f0-77c8-4dda-901b-bc04881938cd	LE - Making Marriage Work (Dr. Gottman) - Principle 3: Turn Toward Each Other Instead of Away	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Principle 3: Turn Toward Each Other Instead of Away**\\n\\n\\nDr. Gottman describes the mundane ways that happy couples respond to one another, acknowledging a comment about seeing a bird out the window, a reminder about needing to get a letter in the mail, and countless other minor comments. He refers to these comments and gestures as \\"bids\\" by one partner to the other; attempts to connect and share a moment, a thought, or an experience. He notes that dissatisfied couples tend not to respond to these \\"bids\\" and fail to listen or to regularly acknowledge comments or gestures made by the other. A pattern of not responding to a partner's bids; turning away instead of turning toward the partner can lead both to feel shut out, disconnected, and less satisfied in their relationship.\\n\\nDr. Gottman has identified at least two frequent barriers to turning toward one's partner. The first involves failing to notice a bid because it includes negative emotions, such as anger. His book provides an excellent example of this: Say Carl wants Lena to come to bed but she is returning e-mails. His bid is, \\"Please come to bed with me.\\" But it comes out as, \\"You're dealing with your e-mails now? You had all night?\\" If Lena focuses on his plea and not his tone, she has the opportunity to respond positively: \\"Good point. I'll be right there.\\" Although it can be very natural to respond defensively to statements like these, see if you can take a moment before responding to see whether there is a bid for connection from your partner. If there is, pause again to try to respond positively to the bid itself, and try to overlook the negative phrasing that your partner may not have intended to convey.\\n\\nThe second barrier to responding to bids involves distraction caused by digital devices; TV, computers, tablets, and smart phones, all of which tend to grab out attention and keep us from noticing when our partner may be trying to connect. There are many different ways to address this, but the objective would be to establish mutually agreed upon times during which both partners will put screens away for set periods of time, allowing them to be available to attend to and respond to one another.\\n\\n**Responding to Your Partner's Strong Emotions**\\n\\nIt can be uncomfortable to turn toward your partner when they are experiencing strong anger, fear, or sadness. However, Dr. Gottman notes that couple with the strongest relationships appear to live by the motto, \\"When you are in pain, the world stops and I listen\\" (Gottman, p. 103). You can be more effective in supporting your distressed partner by acknowledging the difficulty you have with their strong emotions, and then attempting to understand what they are expressing without trying to solve the problem for them. You can help your partner with phrases that invite them to share more: \\"Tell me what concerns you about this,\\" and \\"What you're saying is important.\\" Open-ended questions can also be helpful, such as: \\"What can I do to help you?\\" and \\"How are you seeing the situation?\\" However, it's best to avoid asking \\"Why\\" questions, such as \\"Why do you think that?\\" as these can be perceived as challenging the legitimacy of the person's experience. Instead of trying to problem-solve, focus first on simply bearing witness to your partner's distress, paraphrasing back to them what they are expressing, and demonstrating that you are listening and are on their side. \\n\\nThere will likely be times that your partner does not turn toward you when you would like. Although a natural response is to feel hurt and to withdraw, the most effective step is for you to discuss this openly with your partner, without blaming or judging, so that your partner is aware that you would like more connection. \\n\\nWhen there is an argument or period of conflict, try to identify specific ways that you may have contributed to the situation, and identify one or more actions you could take to improve things going forward. Convey to your partner, in a respectful way, one action that he or she could take that could prevent the problem from occurring again. As the two of you practice work through these questions in collaboration, over time you will likely find that you turn toward each other in times of conflict, instead of turning away.", "title": "Principle 3: Turn Toward Each Other Instead of Away", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:28:28.556699+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:18.906318+00	\N	f

In addition, this connection can allow you to debrief when needed, so that you need not feel burdened by carrying around a disturbing memory or concern.

For more than 40 years he has observed how well couples do in terms of relationship stability and harmony, and he has identified core characteristics that allow him to predict with significant accuracy which couples will remain happily together, and which will divorce. His research has also identified steps that each partner can take to improve their interactions with their partner, and strengthen their relationship. Dr. Gottman has identified seven principles for making relationships work, and these will be reviewed in the following sections. Before getting to these seven principles, in the next section we will first describe some of the warning signals of possible problems in the relationship. If you notice any of these warning signals in your own marriage or couples relationship, you can look more closely at the seven principles for healthy relationships, and see what changes you can make to get your relationship on solid footing. If you are interested in a deeper dive into this topic, Dr. Gottman's outstanding book is available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Principles-Making-Marriage-Work/dp/0553447718/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=DSXDGVNRYTP4ZPG30X4S).", "title": "Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:26:22.82297+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:10:57.127507+00	\N	f
9328720a-2844-4b3d-8fbc-30c71919df06	LE - Making Marriage Work (Dr. Gottman) - The Four Horsemen of the (Marriage) Apocalypse	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **The Four Horsemen of the (Marriage) Apocalypse**\\n\\n\\nDr. Gottman has identified four negative interaction styles that are strongly associated with relationship distress: Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling. The more that these negative interaction styles occur in a relationship, the less likely couples are to be happy in their relationship, and the less likely they are to stay together. \\n\\nReview the examples below, and see whether they are occurring in your relationship. \\n\\n**Criticism**\\n\\nPartners in healthy relationships will sometimes complain about their partner's behavior, but generally avoid criticizing the partner as a person. Healthy complaining usually includes three steps: \\n\\n*   An emotion (\\"I'm frustrated\\") \\n*   A specific event (\\"You didn't start the laundry this morning\\")\\n*   A request for a specific behavior (\\"Please start the laundry now\\")\\n\\nDr. Gottman's book includes the following examples to distinguish health complaints from unhealthy criticism.\\n\\n**Complaint:** \\"There's no gas in the car. I'm upset that you didn't fill it up like you said you would. Could you please deal with it tomorrow?\\"   \\n**Criticism:** \\"Why can't you ever remember anything? I told you a thousand times to fill up the tank, and you didn't, you're always so careless.\\" \\n\\nUnhealthy criticism involves making negative, global statements about the partner as a person: \\"Why are you so selfish?\\"; \\"You never help out at home\\"; \\"You only think about yourself.\\" These critical statements are much more harmful to the other partner, and toxic to the relationship. When disagreeing with your partner, keep an ear out for the words \\"always\\" and \\"never.\\" These are usually associated with unhealthy criticism. Try rephrasing your concerns using this formula: \\"I feel \\\\[emotion\\\\] about \\\\[specific situation\\\\]. I would like \\\\[request for the partner to do a specific behavior at a specific time\\\\].\\" \\n\\n**Contempt**\\n\\nContempt can take different forms, including sarcasm, eye rolling, name-calling, and hurtful jokes. When contempt is expressed in relationships, the other partner almost always responds defensively, sometimes lashing back after being hurt. Contempt may be expressed when a partner feels morally superior to the other, such as by being more frugal, harder working, tidier, or any number of areas. Rather than noticing their differences with their partner, they convey a sense of being superior to their partner, and disgust with the partner's perceived inadequacies.\\n\\nContempt tends to emerge across time, when a couple does not successfully resolve or accept their differences. As negative beliefs about the partner's differences are held and increase over time, an attitude of one's own moral superiority tends to strengthen, along with an increasing sense of contempt and disgust toward the partner. Soon, there is less of a focus on solving problems and resolving conflict with the partner, and more of an emphasis on shining a spotlight on the other's shortcomings. \\n\\nKeep a close watch for this pattern of interaction with your partner, as contempt is especially poisonous for relationships. If you notice this pattern in your relationship, review carefully the seven principles for making marriage work, described later in this article. \\n\\n**Defensiveness**\\n\\nIt is entirely understandable why a person would be defensive after hearing complaints from their partner; no one wants to have their mistakes or flaws pointed out. However, being defensive does not tend to help resolve the conflict, in part because it often involves redirecting blame for a situation back at the first partner.\\n\\nExamples of defensiveness would include explaining (\\"I didn't get it done because I ran out of time\\"; \\"I was too tired\\"), and taking the innocent victim role (\\"Why don't you notice all the good things I do? Nothing I do is good enough for you.\\").\\n\\nWhile defensiveness is understandable, it can be a problem primarily because it gets in the way of more effective ways of solving problems when they arise. \\n\\n**Stonewalling**\\n\\nIn distressed relationships, the stonewaller actively disengages from interactions with the partner - avoiding eye contact, remaining silent, giving no indication that the other partner has been heard. In short, he is behaving almost like a stone wall unresponsive and indifferent. This behavior tends to occur later in the relationship, and occurs much more frequently in men than in women. \\n\\nAlthough stonewallers may believe their behavior is helpful because it avoids noisy arguing and yelling, stonewalling is problematic because it blocks communication, prevents the couple from solving their relationship problems, and creates increasing distance and detachment.\\n\\n_**Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work:**_ The relationship problem behaviors described above can harm or destroy relationships. However, Dr. Gottman has fortunately identified behaviors that you and your partner can target to improve and strengthen your relationship, allowing you and your partner to enjoy a closer, more fulfilling relationship. The seven principles are summarized and described in the following sections.", "title": "The Four Horsemen of the (Marriage) Apocalypse", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:26:52.611915+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:02.647886+00	\N	f
a3e8e03b-3027-4b56-a8df-5c696781cfc1	LE - Making Marriage Work (Dr. Gottman) - Principle 2: Nurture Your Fondness and Admiration	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Principle 2: Nurture Your Fondness and Admiration**\\n\\n\\n**Learning from History**\\n\\nDr. Gottman writes that _\\"fondness and admiration are antidotes for contempt.\\"_ Although most couples start out with fond feelings for their partner, these feelings can erode over time. If this has been happening in your relationship, you can rekindle fondness and admiration by keeping an eye out for small, minor actions by your partner that you can appreciate. Notice these actions, and offer sincere admiration or gratitude when you see them. This may feel unnatural at first, but strengthening this habit of expressing admiration doesn't mean faking it; instead, it involves realistically noticing and appreciating out loud things that your partner has already been doing, but that you may have been overlooking. Dr. Gottman described research in which trained observers recorded the number of positive actions couples made in an evening together. When they asked couples who were having relationship problems to recall the evening, the partners noticed only half of the positive interactions that objective researchers had recorded. This means that it is easy for couples who are having problems to unintentionally fail to notice the positive things their partner is actually doing. If you commit to searching for instances of small, positive actions that your partner is making each day, you will be opening your eyes to qualities in your partner that will help rekindle your fondness and admiration. And telling your partner that you appreciate these acts will have a very positive effect on his or her feelings about you and about your relationship. \\n\\n**Fanning the Flames**\\n\\nSpending a few minutes each day reflecting on what is likable or admirable about your partner may be enough to reactivate your positive feelings. If not, Dr. Gottman recommends a few simple exercises. First, try to come up with five things you would like to express appreciation for. Examples include \\"Thanks for washing the dishes,\\" \\"I really liked how warm you were with the kids,\\" \\"thanks for listening to me,\\" \\"I appreciate how hard you've been working,\\" and so on. You can try this exercise occasionally, or even make a habit of giving at least five appreciations to your partner each day.\\n\\nAnother exercise, which may require one or more uninterrupted hours to complete, would be to review your early history as a couple, focusing on what attracted you to each other, and the positive views you had of one another and of your relationship. It is important that the focus remain on the positives, with any complaints set aside for another time. This discussion would include topics like these: How did you first meet, and what made you notice your partner? What are some of your most vivid memories from your early days of dating? What was the process like in deciding to commit to each other or get married? What stands out as some of your happiest experiences as a committed couple? \\n\\nA third exercise involves developing a list of positive characteristics, and then noting each instance that your partner displays these qualities. Each time you observe these qualities in your partner, remind yourself how fortunate you are to be with this person. [Dr. Gottman's book](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Principles-Making-Marriage-Work/dp/0553447718/ref=sr_1_1?crid=216I2SN2ZNCRL&dchild=1&keywords=the+seven+principles+for+making+marriage+work&qid=1591827759&s=books&sprefix=the+seven+pr%2Cstripbooks%2C231&sr=1-1) contains a long list of such adjectives, but some examples include adventurous, aware, balanced, caring, clever, considerate, dynamic, easygoing, fair, forgiving, generous, gutsy, honest, humble, imaginative, joyful, lively, loyal, neat, outgoing, optimistic, persistent, private, reasonable, sensitive, smart, and so on. Seeking examples of times that your partner engages in these behaviors will help you to focus on what is positive about your partner, and giving these behaviors a positive label will increase your fondness and admiration for your partner.", "title": "Principle 2: Nurture Your Fondness and Admiration", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:27:55.455833+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:13.5793+00	\N	f

The emotional toll that this work can take often remains invisible, but has a significant impact on many correctional officers, their families, and the department. This can include problems with increased anger, depression, anxiety, and feeling burned out. These problems tend to progress gradually, and may not be noticed while they are developing. Correctional officers may feel discouraged after making an error, or being reprimanded by a supervisor. They may not notice the self-doubt and belief they are a failure as an officer. This generalized and inaccurate way of thinking can have significant effects, if not checked. Similarly, repeated incidents of frustration and anger may indicate that an angry outlook is becoming a habit, which can lead to problems at home and can interfere with work performance.\\n\\nAn important principle for the New Hire is to be proactive about managing emotional health. Be on the lookout for signs of negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, or anger, that may be lasting for many hours out of the day, or are occurring more days than not. The Self-Assessments within this app include quick screeners that can help you decide about taking steps to take charge of any problem emotions. In addition, the app has articles that offer guidance on ways to enhance and maintain your emotional well-being. Take a look at the modules on **Emotional Health** and **Depression**, for example, for helpful information on those topics.\\n\\nBecause  correctional work can be very stressful, many officers find that when they go off shift, they become very lethargic and just want to “zone out.” This process is described in detail in Dr. Kevin Gilmartin’s excellent book, **_Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement: A Guide for Officers and Their Families_**. Dr. Gilmartin describes  the “Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster,” which leads officers to spend much of their off-duty time staring passively at the TV (or computer or phone), returning to alertness only around the time they are due to go back on shift. This can have a harmful impact on relationships with family and friends, who may feel shut out or uncared for by their officer family members. As a new officer, it is very important that you be aware of this all-too-common pattern, and that you commit in advance to ensure the well-being of your close relationships. The **Emotional Survival** module provides outstanding information on how this happens, and how you can guard against it. The Correctional Wellness app also includes a condensed summary of Dr. Gilmartin’s book, located within the Wellness Toolkit highlighting key topics and strategies for emotional survival. \\n\\nIt is often the case that family members or others close to an officer are amongst the first to notice when an officer’s attitudes and emotions begin to shift in a negative direction. When a spouse or others close to an officer provide feedback after noticing changes that raise concerns, it is important to avoid becoming defensive. Family members often see negative symptoms before officers themselves become aware of such symptoms, so listening to their concerns and taking time to consider their perspectives is important. When family takes the time to provide an officer with feedback, listening carefully is important as it helps to preserve high-quality relationships and can also provide valuable information which would otherwise be missed until the problems begins to worsen. Rather than allowing problems to worsen over time, feedback from family and other loved ones often provides important opportunities to deal with negative developments sooner rather than later.", "title": "Managing Emotional Wellness", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 16:56:31.922792+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 16:56:31.922792+00	\N	f

By being on the lookout for warning signs of burnout, and by taking an active coping stance, you can take steps to create barriers against burnout. These include taking good care of yourself through exercise and adequate sleep, maintaining strong, supportive relationships; and strengthening your connection with the core values and principles that led you to a career in law enforcement. \\n\\nIf you believe you may be at risk for burnout, try to make these changes a priority:\\n\\n**Exercise can build physical and mental reserves to help inoculate against burnout.** Plan a regular exercise routine that you can stick with, get it on your calendar, and follow the schedule as a matter of highest priority. If it’s been a while since you’ve exercised, be sure to start out easy to avoid injuries. \\n\\n**Burnout thrives on exhaustion and getting sufficient, restful sleep is key to avoiding exhaustion.** Take note of anything that has been interfering with getting 7-8 hours of quality sleep, and spend 10 minutes (or more if needed) to take care of any barriers to quality sleep. This may include setting a reminder on your phone to start winding down for bed and then making sure you take good care of yourself by reserving enough time for restorative, refreshing sleep.\\n\\n**Strong, supportive relationships help to lessen the effects of burnout, and can even prevent burnout entirely in some cases.** Write down at least two relationships that have been important to you, and set a time when you can be with each of these people in a way that strengthens your relationship—going for a walk, making a call, setting a video chat. If you’ve started to feel burnout there’s a good chance that relationships have been on the backburner. When you are feeling worn down, reconnecting with people who know you and care about you can be like medicine.\\n\\n**Feeling deeply motivated and inspired by a noble mission is an antidote to burnout.** Reflect on your core values by thinking, “What do I want my life to have been about?” You can do this in writing or just in your mind, and as you do so, consider what changes you might make day to day that will help you live out these core values at home and on duty.", "title": " Summary", "summary": "Law enforcement officers have a high risk of burnout because of the demanding and difficult nature of their work, and this can result in numerous negative outcomes for work and personal relationships.

4945b687-a1da-4b31-b6b0-56853153b877	LE - Making Marriage Work (Dr. Gottman) - Principle 5: Solve Your Solvable Problems	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Principle 5: Solve Your Solvable Problems**\\n\\n\\nDr. Gottman notes that there are two types of problems in marriage: solvable problems, and perpetual problems. Many problems in relationships are perpetual, and cannot be solved for example, one partner wants to have children and the other does not; one partner does not mind a messy house, while the other prefers things to be spotless. Perhaps surprisingly, all relationships, including the happiest and most stable relationships, involve perpetual problems. The task for couples is to respond effectively to the perpetual problems, so that they don't harm the relationship.\\n\\nWhen couples are faced with solvable problems, there are certain approaches to solving such problems that distinguish high-functioning couples from less stable couples. Dr. Gottman has observed that couples with strong relationships tend to resolve their conflicts utilizing general steps, which are summarized below.\\n\\nFirst, they start softly, using gentle words, rather than criticism. They mention their own responsibility for the problem, then describe the emotions they feel about the specific situation, and what they would like from their partner.\\n\\nSecond, they make repair attempts, and are willing to receive repair attempts from their partner. This can include trying to de-escalate when things get heated; offering or accepting an apology; declining an opportunity to point out an error in what the partner has said or to attack a weak argument; and using gentle humor to break tension. \\n\\nThe third component of effective conflict resolution involves taking steps to soothe your partner and to soothe yourself. It can be difficult to communicate when either partner is anxious, angry, or frustrated. If this occurs, the distressed partner can try sitting in a comfortable chair and spending a few minutes focusing on breathing, aiming for slow, steady, deep breaths. Next, instruct each muscle group to relax, and notice the relaxation spreading as it occurs. You can try tightening a muscle group for two seconds, and then releasing the tension, and focus on relaxing the muscles more and more deeply. Once you have engaged in this self-soothing (or partner soothing), the two of you will be better prepared to return to working through conflicts.\\n\\nThe fourth component of conflict resolution is compromise. This involves the fourth principle described earlier: accepting influence. This requires that each partner be open to the other's opinions and wishes, and be willing to work together to find common ground. One way to decide whether you are willing to compromise is to notice your posture during the discussion. Are you sitting back with your arms folded while your partner talks? Do you smirk or shake your head? If so, it is unlikely that you are truly open to compromise. Try changing your posture, so that you are sitting slightly forward, hands on your knees, listening attentively. Make the decision to carefully and respectfully consider what your partner is saying, without dismissing it and without raising counterarguments.\\n\\nBy using these steps as structure when trying to resolve conflicts with your partner, you increase the likelihood of maintaining positive feelings toward each other, regardless of how successfully the conflict is resolved. Remember, all couples live with several perpetual, unsolvable problems. The key is to accept these problems while continuing to honor and respect the relationship you have with your partner.", "title": "Principle 5: Solve Your Solvable Problems", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:29:31.469989+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:28.539907+00	\N	f

f05abc7f-60b9-413c-88a0-f673bf1fe497	LE - Making Marriage Work (Dr. Gottman) - Principle 6: Overcome Gridlock	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Principle 6: Overcome Gridlock**\\n\\n\\nCouples can become gridlocked over any number of topics. One wants to take trips every weekend; the other wants to work on house projects. He wants a dog; she wants a cat. Although all couples have some differences that can't be resolved, they often manage to accommodate these issues. When they cannot manage these differences, gridlock may occur. \\n\\n**Dr. Gottman describes four characteristics of gridlocked disagreements:**\\n\\n1.  The same argument has happened again and again without resolution.\\n2.  Both partners are unable to use humor, empathy, or affection when addressing the problem.\\n3.  The issue has become more polarized across time.\\n4.  Each partner is unwilling to compromise because it would feel like giving up a core value or belief.\\n\\nIf you use the principles described earlier in this article, it is very possible to avoid gridlock altogether. For example, as you deepen your affection and admiration, you will find it much easier to understand your partner's needs, and be more capable of understanding his or her position, and more willing to make changes that will make your partner feel cherished and appreciated. As you practice turning toward each other, rather than turning away, you will become more attuned to your partner's needs, and less likely to become entrenched in a position that is opposed to what is important to your partner. \\n\\nGridlock may occur over seemingly trivial matters, such as whether to go out to dinner every Friday evening. However, these activities may be linked to deeply felt memories and dreams. For example, someone whose loving family went out for dinner every Friday night may cherish this ideal, and may want to continue this in her adult life, hoping to experience the sense of connection with close family in their weekly tradition. If her partner is not aware of the significance of this Friday night ritual, he may find her requests to go out for dinner most Friday nights unreasonable and selfish. It is therefore helpful for partners to continue to develop deep familiarity with one another's dreams, wishes, and experiences, part of enhancing their \\"love maps,\\" described earlier. \\n\\nThe details of the compromise are less important than the approach taken in resolving the disagreement. While distressed couples are more likely to persist in trying to get their way, happy couples work as a team to break the gridlock. They are attuned to one another's dreams, and develop a solution that allows the hopes and desires of each partner to be met. The more mutual respect and awareness of the other partner's dreams, the less likely gridlock is to occur in the first place. \\n\\nWhen gridlock does occur, try searching for the dreams and aspirations that are involved in your own position; ask yourself what it means to you to do the activity you are proposing? What does your desire to do this remind you of? What would it mean if you were unable to do this activity? For example, if you are having gridlock because you want to complete a college degree, but your partner is resistant because of financial concerns, try to identify what completing a college degree means to you. Is it a sense of being more knowledgeable about the world? About demonstrating your competence? Following through on a promise made to your parents? The dream associated with going to college will help explain the emotional charge that this issue has for you. On the other side, what dreams might your attending college threaten in your partner? If he or she grew up in a financially chaotic home, then financial stability may be a core value that he or she would be abandoning if you took on debt to attend college. For the partner, having ample savings and no debt may be an aspiration that developed during years of financial uncertainty as a child. Once the dreams of both partners related to this gridlock are made clear, the decision about whether and when to attend college can be made in a setting where both partners are understood, and their concerns and aspirations can be honored and respected, as you work to find the best solution as a team.", "title": "Principle 6: Overcome Gridlock", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:30:02.385834+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:33.324909+00	\N	f

Doing so creates opportunities to recognize values and ideals shared in common, which then enhances and deepens a sense of shared meaning. \\n\\nDr. Gottman has identified what he refers to as the Four Pillars of Shared Meaning, each of which contributes to deepening relationships. \\n\\n**Pillar One refers to \\"Rituals of Connection.\\"** \\n\\nHaving regular structured events, such as meals together every evening, or attending religious services each week, provides a time of predictable, shared experience for a couple or family. Even if you did not grow up with such rituals, it is never too late to start. You can establish your own traditions that reflect your own priorities: camping regularly, as part of your love of nature; or having everyone say what they are grateful for at special meals, as a way of strengthening a sense of gratitude. Consider trying to find two different rituals of connection that you could bring into your relationship. This could include a new activity related to birthdays, graduation, or religious holidays such as Christmas or Passover. Rituals can also be associated with recreation, such as having a regular date night, or planning romantic trips. And even adding small, daily rituals can become a frequent opportunity to establish a shared sense of experience and meaning, such as how you greet each other when returning home, or shows of affection while getting ready for sleep. Across time, the regularity of these shared experiences can deepen a couple's sense of shared experience. \\n\\n**Pillar Two involves \\"Support for Each Other's Roles.\\"**\\n\\nCouples are more likely to have a shared sense of meaning when they have similar expectations of one another's roles as a partner or as a parent. For example, some may view the husband as a breadwinner and protector, and the wife as a caregiver. Others may expect a more egalitarian role, and view both partners as equally responsible for supporting the family and caring for children. Take some time to discuss with your partner what your roles as a husband, wife, partner, or parent mean to you, and how your view of your role may be similar to or different from your parents' view. Discuss any changes you might want to make to this role, or changes you might wish to see in the way your partner experiences his or her role. \\n\\n**Pillar Three involves \\"Shared Goals.\\"** \\n\\nIdentifying and discussing with your partner your own goals and your partner's goals can help to identify what each of you wants to accomplish, why these goals are important, and how each of you can support the other in pursuing these goals. There may be opportunities to blend goals that each partner has so that they can be pursued together. Doing so can bring couples closer, and further enrich and deepen their relationship. As you discuss your goals with your partner, see whether your relationship currently supports your goals. Does the relationship support your partner's goals? What changes could be made so that each of you is able to successfully work toward achieving your goals?\\n\\n**Pillar Four involves \\"Shared Values and Symbols.\\"** \\n\\nThese values and symbols may be related to religious practices with which either or both partners may be affiliated. Non-religious partners also have developed belief systems, and may be able to share these beliefs in ways that deepen their connection with one another. These may include treasured family photos on the wall, that serve as reminders of one's place in a larger family tree. This can include family stories that are shared, representing important concepts such as courage, loyalty, and generosity. Discuss with your partner what symbols reflect your family and your family's values. Consider the meaning of different objects or spaces in your home that represent something about your values, or hold special meaning.", "title": "Principle 7: Create Shared Meaning", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:30:39.848311+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:38.508464+00	\N	f

Some people tend to breathe more shallowly when tense, or hold their breath without meaning to do so, during moments of tension or anxiety. Breathing exercises can help with noticing and reducing tension and emotional distress by focusing attention on the breathing and guiding it to reach a calm, steady pace. One method is to place both feet on the floor, and sit in a generally upright posture, but without straining to do so.  In this position, notice the sensation of the breath entering the nostrils, and count slowly to four with each intake of breath. Pause, and exhale steadily and calmly, counting to four slowly as you do so. If you notice that your breath is shallow, see if you can breathe in a little more deeply (without straining to do so), and let the air out a little more completely. Try to do this for 10-15 cycles of breathing in and out, with the attitude of observing yourself becoming calmer, more centered, and more aware of your breathing. This exercise often helps reduce tension or distress, and may help you to maintain a greater sense of peace while working on difficult ICAC-related tasks. [Click here](https://www.cordico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Breath-Focus-Mindfulness-Audio-Script-Chief-Tejada.mp3) if you prefer to listen to a recorded script for an audio guided breathing exercise.", "title": "Coping Strategy: Breathing Exercises ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:43:11.625298+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:05:28.809569+00	\N	f

In reality, children’s natural tendencies sometimes make them unwilling – and sometimes unable, depending on their age – to always do what you would like them to. One of the best ways to help your children behave appropriately, and to listen when you ask them to do something, is to set up the situation so that your child has a strong probability of successful behavior. As you read on, it’s important to know an abundance of research shows children who have positive associations with following instructions and learning to do chores, are much less likely to argue or otherwise try to avoid them in the future.\\n\\nLet’s take an example. If 13-year-old Jessie comes home from school and immediately hears, “I need you to take out the trash, and pick up your room, and then do your homework,” it is very likely that at least one of these tasks will not be completed and may not even be remembered. As a teenager, it’s normal to want a break after school before starting homework. From the parent’s point of view, when one of the tasks isn’t completed a common experience is frustration or anger, which can escalate to demands or threats of punishment. The teen then feels resentful and angry that the good behavior wasn’t noticed, and that they were expected to remember and do everything right away. Episodes like these are not disasters, but when they occur repeatedly, they can impact relationships and develop into more serious conflicts.\\n\\nYou can help your child develop behaviors you want by setting up the situation for success. The basic approach is to break behaviors into smaller chunks, initially provide prompts and guidance combined with positive reinforcement, and then backing off as success is developed. This is similar to how many people learned to drive. First, their parent or instructor told or showed them step by step how to put the car in gear, when to press the gas, when to press the brake, and so on. With practice, these instructions became less frequent, until driving became independent.\\n\\nPrompts\\n\\nResearch on the most effective methods for getting children to follow directions shows calm, regular guidance improves parenting success. In practice, this involves setting up the situation with prompts. Prompts include verbal instructions (“Please brush your teeth now”), written reminders, or physical prompts, such as guiding the child in the behavior (e.g., guiding their hands while they tie their shoes). One of the leading experts in parenting research, Dr. Alan Kazdin, recommends giving instructions that are short, clear, and specific. He also found it helps to be near your child when giving the instruction, using a calm voice, and starting with “please.” For example, “Please put away your toys” was more effective that saying, “Put away your toys now.” When you first ask your child to start a new behavior, like washing the dishes, it can be helpful to prompt them by starting to do the task with them. Research shows combining the verbal prompt – “Please wash the dishes now” – with the prompt of physically assisting is more effective than either alone. Even better, Dr. Kazdin found that joining in the task (“Let’s start washing the dishes together”) helped children to be successful, and also decreased the likelihood of arguing about the task. While you may feel as though you shouldn’t have to help with chores your child is supposed to be responsible for, studies show fostering a guiding approach and loving relationship with your child is worth the extra 10 minutes for a few days to help them be successful learning tasks and helpful behaviors. Taking this small amount of extra time in the short run, saves time in the long run. \\n\\nSetting Events\\n\\nIn addition to prompts, setting events can affect behavior without using a specific instruction, can increase a child’s motivation to try something new, or help you with a task. For example, saying, “You probably can’t do this now because it’s too hard for children your age, but when you’re older you may be able to” can spark interest in the task, and make it a challenge. Children are usually more motivated to try the task and stick with it than if you simply told the child to do it. Parents of a child who resists dressing himself independently might stop arguing and pleading with him, and simply say, “It’s ok if you can’t dress yourself just yet. When you’re a bigger boy you’ll be able to.” The “bigger boy” phrase usually holds a special status for young boys. By backing off on their efforts to push their son into dressing himself, and linking independent dressing with something that “bigger boys” do, a child will become significantly more motivated to try dressing on his own. \\n\\nOffer Choices\\n\\nWhenever possible, offer choices in the way you phrase your requests. Children (and adults) don’t usually like being told what to do. But if they are asked to choose among two or more different tasks, they will feel much more independent, and less resistant to doing the task. For example, “Would you rather have your snack before or after you finish your homework?” or “You can brush your teeth first or take your bath first.” Although parents end up giving many instructions to their children over the years, they can reduce the sense of coercion by including choices as often as possible when giving these instructions. This also makes the child less likely to resist, as the child is actively choosing which activity to do. Ultimately, keep in mind you want your child to accurately perceive choices and become effective at executing a series of tasks. In the beginning, they have to learn through your guidance the steps involved in larger tasks (such as getting ready for bed) and develop confidence doing each step without you there.\\n\\nIt can be tempting to think that your children should be able to do what you ask them to do without any special guidance. This may be true, depending on their age. But would you rather have your child obey orders immediately, but feel resentful or distant from you; or have your relationship grow and deepen as you take the time to help and guide them to success? Most parents would choose the second option. Moreover, these strategies help officers and staff remove the emotion from parenting and increase their child’s independent task completion. The great news is that, if you do follow the second option, your children will be more likely in the long run to develop and maintain positive behaviors – cleaning their room, completing homework, helping around the house – with less need for you to remind them to do so.\\n\\nKey Points for Giving Instructions\\n\\n_Do These:_\\n\\n*   Use a calm voice, and be specific about what you’re requesting.\\n*   Use the word “please” when making a request. It helps you soften the request from seeming like an order, and models good manners.\\n*   If possible, be physically close to your child to direct their attention and focus. It also prompts you to avoid using a loud voice.\\n*   Try to include choices that the child can choose from. Even if they all involve some sort of chore, the child still gets to exercise some independence in making the choice, and it’s a skill they need later in life.\\n\\n_Avoid These:_\\n\\n*   Avoid dramatic gestures like snapping your fingers or pointing your finger at the child.\\n*   Avoid saying, “because I said so,” to justify your request. Try to give instructions only once or twice calmly; avoid repeating the instructions several times in a short period (this is nagging, which is ineffective).\\n*   Resist the urge to describe what will happen if they don’t follow your instructions (e.g., “If you don’t study, you’ll never get into college”).", "title": "Following Instructions: Set the Situation ", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:13:34.175584+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:13:34.175584+00	\N	f

We've already discussed that by far the most effective way to help guide your child's behavior is through positive reinforcement of the desired behavior. One of the most powerful forms of positive reinforcement is completely free and readily available: your attention and your praise. Simply telling your child \\"Great job in putting your toys away!\\" or \\"I'm so proud of how you brushed your teeth the first time I asked!\\" is a very effective and valuable way to reinforce that behavior. When using praise as reinforcement, try to do it immediately after the behavior. You can even coax children towards the right behavior by reinforcing initial steps. In the case of a child who previously resisted brushing teeth, you can praise them as soon as they pick up the toothbrush, letting them know immediately that you are happy with their behavior. It's also important to say specifically what you are praising them for. Saying \\"You're so great!\\" doesn't indicate the behavior you are pleased about, but saying, \\"I really liked how you turned off the video game right when I asked you\\" gives specific details about the important behavior, and indicates exactly what they need to do next time to earn your praise.\\n\\n**Use Your Power Wisely**\\n\\nAttention is naturally reinforcing, and simply commenting on what your child is doing can encourage the behavior. For example, if you leave your child alone when they are playing quietly, they may begin doing things to draw your attention. This may include pulling the cat's tail, or drawing on the walls, or using profanity, even if it gets a negative reaction from you, the attention can still be reinforcing. For this reason, it's helpful to provide attention at times when your child is simply playing, drawing, or any \\"ok\\" activity that is not undesirable. This helps to reinforce these \\"good\\" and \\"ok\\" behaviors, making them occur more frequently than the undesirable behaviors you hope to discourage. \\n\\n**Reward Charts**\\n\\nWhen praise and attention are not reinforcing enough, parents can use a very simple point or chart system. Clearly specify the desired behavior (going to bed without protesting within one minute of being asked). Explain that they will be able to earn some fun treats or privileges, and that each time they do the target behavior, they will earn points towards the treat (if the child picks up toys after a parent asks him only one time, then he will earn 2 points, 6 points earns one grab bag treat). Position the chart where it's easy to see. Parents can purchase very low-cost toys, candies, and other treats or identify desired privileges (staying up 10 minutes extra, choosing what's for dinner, renting a movie, taking them to the a park) and write them on cards. Each time the child executes the behavior, you provide praise, and inform him that because he put away his toys he earned 2 points. Write the 2 points on his point chart together. When he has earned 6 points, express pride, show him on the chart how he has earned six points, and encourage him to redeem a treat. One of the most important components is simply making explicit to your child that they are being rewarded for their behavior, and consistently making this desired behavior something that receives attention and praise until it is established.  It is remarkable how quickly behaviors will increase when they are reinforced consistently with simple, low-cost or no-cost reinforcers such as attention, praise, and inexpensive treats. Some parents get caught in the trap of thinking, \\"I shouldn't have to reinforce my child to do what they're supposed to.\\" Unfortunately, this framing of the problem increases the parent's frustration and negative interactions with their child instead of working on the goal to improve behavior. Within a few weeks, you will be able to fade this reinforcement, and then let go of the point chart for that particular behavior. You will likely be able to maintain the behavior simply through periodically noticing and praising the behavior when you notice it. If the desired behavior begins to disappear for some reason, you can reinstate the point chart and increase your focus on reinforcing the behavior to bring it back.\\n", "title": "Reinforcing Positive Behaviors", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:18:27.217921+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:18:27.217921+00	\N	f

For example, _\\"I'm a monster,\\"_ or _\\"I can't be trusted,\\"_ or _\\"I don't deserve to be loved (or respected, or treated well).\\"_ Such drastic conclusions may be an attempt to \\"undo\\" or atone for the moral injury event; however, such judgments are almost always highly inaccurate. In addition, these self-judgments will interfere with performing work effectively, and with functioning as a spouse, partner, parent, or friend.

If you experienced an event that led you to have persistence of guilt or shame toward yourself, or contempt or anger toward another person, this event may have involved moral injury.

However, the temporary relief in the short run would be greatly outweighed by the harmful consequences of beginning to drink too much. For one, alcohol tends to interfere with normal sleep cycles.

Playing the game takes up virtually all of a person's visuospatial processing resources (this is the kind of mental ability involved in deciding whether your car will fit into a parking spot, or how best to arrange boxes in a closet). Several studies have found that by first re-activating a traumatic memory, and then playing Tetris, a number of changes occur in the way the activated traumatic memory is stored and represented in memory, making it less likely to return in the form of an intrusive memory. Most of this research involves exposing volunteers to relatively short versions of traumatic images, such as violent or disturbing clips from a movie (rather than real-world exposure to actual traumatic events). In one study, volunteers were asked to record the frequency of intrusive memories from 3 days after viewing the disturbing clip. They then received an intervention in which the disturbing memories were re-activated by showing them a visual reminder of the disturbing video clip, after which they played Tetris for 15 minutes. A different group played a word-based Quiz game instead of the more visually-oriented Tetris game, and a third group (the Control group) did not engage in any game playing after re-activating the disturbing memory. For the three days after the intervention, the group that played Tetris experienced dramatically fewer intrusive memories than the Control group. Interestingly, those who played the word-based Quiz game after re-activating the disturbing memory also had a reduction in intrusive memories, although not as much as those in the Tetris group. The researchers proposed that re-activating the disturbing memory and then playing Tetris blocked the natural memory reconsolidation process by using up all of the visual memory resources in playing Tetris. As a result, the disturbing memory was believed to be altered in memory storage so that it became less distressing. Another study, also using healthy volunteers, demonstrated similar effects when the Tetris intervention occurred 4 days after exposure to the trauma-related video, and when Tetris was played for only 10 minutes after re-activating the memory of the disturbing video, strengthening the evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention.", "title": " Research on Video Games For Intrusive Memories", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:46:48.925216+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:06:17.696889+00	\N	f

Changing these behaviors involves some additional steps beyond giving instructions. Extensive research with families identified two keys: punishment is not as effective as guidance; and, parents who rely primarily on punishment both worsen their relationship and don't get behavior change. Given these findings, this section describes how positive reinforcement can be used to promote things you want your child to do (sharing, completing chores), and decrease things you don't want them to do (fighting, throwing tantrums). We focus on three steps: Set Your Goal, Identify the Positive Opposite, and Break it Down. \\n\\n**Set Your Goals**\\n\\nBe concrete and describe what change you want to see. Asking your child to, \\"Be good\\" does not involve any specific behavior. However, \\"finish your homework\\" or setting a goal of making requests without whining are behaviors we can observe. Try to describe exactly what it would look like (either what they would be saying or doing). This gives a target that you can start to reinforce. \\n\\n**ID the Positive Opposite **\\n\\nTo move from punishing the behavior you don't want, to reinforcing what you do want, identify the positive opposite of what they're doing. \\n\\n**UNWANTED BEHAVIOR**\\n\\n*   Getting out of bed at night\\n*   Leaving dishes in the sink\\n*   Hitting siblings in the car\\n\\n**POSITIVE BEHAVIOR**\\n\\n*   Staying in bed with lights out\\n*   Putting dishes in the dishwasher\\n*   Keeping their hands to themselves\\n\\nResearch strongly demonstrates parents found great success reinforcing behaviors they did want that negative interactions about unwanted behavior. For behaviors you want them not to do, specify a behavior they can do that is incompatible with the undesirable behavior. This allows you to move your sights from punishing one behavior to reinforcing the \\"positive opposite\\" of that behavior. This means more chances for positive interactions with your children, more opportunities for your child to feel successful about changing their behavior, and greater success in actually changing the behavior, a win-win situation!\\n\\n**Break it Down**\\n\\nWhenever you have tasks that involve several steps, start with one or two manageable steps first, and build to the rest as the child becomes successful. \\"Getting ready for bed\\" might involve getting out pajamas, taking a bath, putting on pajamas, putting clothes in a hamper, brushing teeth, and getting into bed. If you start off by requesting all of this at once, it's unlikely they'll be completely successful. Instead, you can start off by asking them, \\"Please get your pajamas out,\\" the first couple of nights, and reinforcing them with praise when they do. Once the first action is well established, you can start adding the next step (\\"Please get your pajamas and then take your bath\\"), and provide reinforcement (such as praise or stickers; more on this later). \\n\\n**Set Your Expectations**\\n\\nAnother important point to make is that behavior change takes time, it is gradual, and children involve a consistent effort for anyone. For children, that consistent effort extends to their parents. The behavior change may take weeks, and there will likely be setbacks, when old behaviors (tantrums, etc.) reappear. Having realistic expectations will help you avoid feeling frustrated when these occur.

These include **high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, high blood sugar (glucose), physical inactivity (lack of exercise), unhealthy diet, obesity,** and **smoking.** In addition to these general factors, law enforcement work may involve sudden transitions from light activity to periods of extremely high stress and high physical demand, placing a heavy demand on the heart.\\n\\nA study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that the risk of sudden cardiac death increased dramatically for police officers during sudden high-stress activities. The risk of sudden cardiac death was 30 to 60 times higher during altercations or restraining suspects, and 30 to 50 times higher during pursuits. The study found that sudden cardiac death is responsible for 10% of all on-duty law enforcement [deaths](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/police-face-higher-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death-during-stressful-duties/). The combination of these risk factors has resulted in law enforcement officers having an especially high rate of cardiovascular-related deaths, including heart conditions other than sudden cardiac death. With these sobering statistics in mind, we review below the risk factors for heart disease. \\n\\n*   **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**  \\n    Hypertension can cause significant harm to health over time. The American Heart Association classifies blood pressure as normal if it is below 120/80. Here, the 120 is the systolic reading (when the heart forces blood through the arteries), and 80 is the diastolic reading (when the heart is at rest). Stage 1 Hypertension reflects blood pressure readings from 130/80 to 139/89, and Stage 2 Hypertension reflects blood pressure of readings 140/90 or higher. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Hypertension are present if either the systolic or diastolic number is in the range described. For example, a blood pressure reading of 135/70 would be considered Stage 1 Hypertension because the Systolic reading is 135, even though the diastolic number (70) is normal.   \\n      \\n    For most people, there are no symptoms of high blood pressure that you would be able to observe. In other words, you could feel normal and still have high blood pressure, and so the only way to be sure about your blood pressure is to check it with a blood pressure instrument. If hypertension remains untreated, it can lead to heart attack, stroke, sexual dysfunction, kidney failure, and loss of vision. These serious health consequences occur because persistently high blood pressure causes damage to the blood vessels that supply the heart, brain, retina, and other parts of the eye, kidneys, sex organs, and all other tissues of the body. Untreated hypertension tends to cause gradual damage to these blood vessels, resulting in the death of tissues such as the retina, heart muscle, kidneys, and so on.   \\n      \\n    One of the most serious consequences of untreated hypertension is a heart attack, in which the damaged arteries around the heart become blocked, preventing adequate blood from supplying the heart muscle. When this occurs, life-threatening damage may occur to the heart muscle, and in fact, many victims of heart attack do not survive. Hypertension also significantly increases the risk for a stroke, in which blood flow to parts of the brain is decreased or blocked entirely. Effects of stroke can range from relatively mild symptoms to devastating injuries including paralysis, inability to speak or understand language, blindness, or death.\\n*   **High Cholesterol**  \\n    There are at least two types of cholesterol: **Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** is considered to be “bad,” and **high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol** is considered to be “good.” High levels of “bad” (LDL) cholesterol promote the buildup of plaques on the lining of the walls of the arteries, which can eventually block the flow of blood. This can cause a heart attack if blood to the heart is blocked, or a stroke if blood to the brain is blocked. High levels of LDL cholesterol are strongly associated with heart disease. Eating foods high in saturated fat (found in fatty meat, cheese, and tropical oils such as palm oil and coconut oil) promotes higher levels of LDL cholesterol and so increases the risk of heart disease. On the other hand, higher levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol appear to be protective against heart disease because it removes circulating LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.   \\n      \\n    Current CDC [guidelines for interpreting cholesterol](https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/cholesterol_screening.htm) scores list desirable (healthy) values as LDL (“bad”) cholesterol at less than 100 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter); HDL (“good”) cholesterol at 60 mg/dl or higher, triglycerides less than 150 mg/dl, and total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl. If you don’t know your cholesterol numbers or have not had your cholesterol tested in recent years, it would be well worth your while to schedule testing with your doctor. If your cholesterol is outside of the healthy ranges described above, talk with your doctor about ways to improve your cholesterol numbers. Steps for modifying your cholesterol are also described later in this module. \\n*   **High Blood Sugar (glucose)**  \\n    High levels of blood sugar (also referred to as glucose) may be a sign of [diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/problems.html), although elevated blood sugar can be present in people without a diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetes involves a deficiency in the body’s ability to produce the right amount of insulin. When working properly, the pancreas releases insulin when blood sugar increases, such as after a meal. Insulin travels through the bloodstream and causes cells throughout the body to open their barriers to allow glucose into the cell, either to be converted for use as energy or to be converted into storage for later use. In diabetes, not enough insulin is produced or released, so higher levels of glucose continue to circulate in the bloodstream. The circulating glucose is harmful to cells throughout the body, including the heart. In fact, heart disease is the most frequent cause of death amongst those with diabetes. When blood sugar levels frequently become elevated, blood vessels supplying the heart become damaged. In addition, the nerve supply for both the heart and blood vessels becomes damaged by elevated blood sugar, making it more difficult for the heart to work effectively. Over time, this can lead to heart disease, disability, and possibly premature death. \\n*   **Physical Inactivity**  \\n    For most of the time humans have been alive, their daily activities included significant physical movement, from hunter-gatherer cultures to pre-industrial farming. Our bodies, including our cardiovascular system, adapted over the centuries for regular physical activity. However, many current jobs involve mostly sitting—at a desk, or behind the wheel of a vehicle. As a result, many people rarely get any exercise unless they explicitly plan to do so. However, many people do not recognize the importance of regular exercise or do not set and follow scheduled times for exercise. This has resulted in a massive increase in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other “diseases of modern life.”   \\n      \\n    Physical inactivity includes prolonged lying, sitting, or standing, either as part of work or free time. This can include seated desk work, driving a vehicle, or standing without significant walking. Free time sedentary activities include watching television, playing video games, being on a smartphone, and other activities that require little physical movement or energy output. Physical inactivity is strongly associated with many negative health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke.   \\n      \\n    There is reason to believe that physical inactivity itself negatively affects health, even for people who get some exercise. Some studies have found that among samples of people who get at least the recommended minimum amount of weekly exercise, (150 minutes of cardiovascular activity) those who spent more hours sitting each day were still at increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke. These results suggest that moving regularly throughout the day, rather than sitting, has heart health benefits above and beyond those of regular planned exercise. It is important to recognize that, unless your job duties involve regular physical activity, it will be up to you to ensure that you are getting adequate regular physical movement throughout the day, and adequate cardiovascular exercise of at least 150 minutes each week. More information on exercise is provided later in this module. \\n\\n[(Source)](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/pubs/docs/sib_aug2013.pdf)\\n\\n*   **Unhealthy Diet**  \\n    Food that is readily available, convenient, affordable, and tasty is, unfortunately, often the worst kind of food for your health. This includes most snacks in vending machines or in convenience stores and most fast foods. However, what you eat daily has an important impact on your heart health. A large study of causes of death in more than 700,000 people found that nearly half of the deaths were associated with unhealthy eating patterns. Heart disease deaths were especially strongly associated with high intake of salt, processed meats, and sugary beverages, and with lower intake of nuts. Death from stroke was associated with excessive salt and low amounts of fruits and vegetables.   One of the main problems with processed, packaged, and restaurant foods is that they often contain excess sodium, partly in the form of table salt (which has the chemical formula NaCl, or sodium chloride.) However, sodium can be present in other foods such as bread, pizza, soups, and ingredients that do not necessarily taste salty, such as baking soda. While the recommended intake of sodium is 2400 milligrams per day, Americans consume an average of 3400 milligrams per day. High sodium intake contributes to high blood pressure, which directly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. While the factors that contribute to heart health are complicated, it is clear that eating too much unhealthy food and not enough healthy food, such as fruits and vegetables, interferes with your body’s ability to maintain optimal heart health. Recommendations for healthy food choices are described later in the module.   \\n     \\n*   **Obesity**  \\n    Food habits that involve consuming larger amounts, eating more frequently, and consuming food and drink that are higher in calories will promote weight gain and obesity, which is an additional risk factor for heart disease. Excessive intake of high-calorie food and drinks, such as soft drinks, donuts, cookies, and other sugar-laden items is especially problematic. Many adults find that their metabolism begins to slow with age so that they burn fewer calories per day than when they were younger. There is also a tendency to simply move less as we get older, which makes us burn even fewer calories. At the same time, our eating habits may tend to stay the same, as we look forward to the same favorite foods, in the same amount, as earlier in life. However, without increasing physical activity to offset the number of calories being consumed, we will naturally store excess calories as fat. If this continues, we become overweight, and then obese.\\n\\n**_Body Mass Index and Obesity_** \\n\\nThe CDC provides a calculator to estimate Body Mass Index (BMI), which you can access here [(CDC BMI calculator.)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html). BMI is based on height and weight and provides a general reference for indicating whether someone is overweight or obese. BMI is not a perfect indication of obesity; for example, weightlifters or others with a lot of muscle mass and little fat will have an inaccurately high BMI, because large muscles weigh more than fat. However, for most other people, BMI provides a good estimate of their BMI. The CDC classifies a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 as Normal, BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 as Overweight, and 30.0 and above as Obese. Having a BMI of 30 to 39 is associated with approximately 65 to 85% higher risk of heart disease compared with having a BMI between 18 and 24.9. A BMI of 40 or higher was associated with 2.5 to 3 times greater risk for cardiovascular disease, compared with the normal BMI range.\\n\\n**_Waist Circumference and Obesity_** \\n\\nThe CDC and American Heart Association have also used waist circumference as an indicator of obesity. Waist circumference is simply the distance around your body at the waist; people with more fat tissue tend to have a greater waist circumference. A waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men, or greater than 35 inches for non-pregnant women, was classified as increased risk for heart disease (coronary vascular disease) and other significant medical problems. To accurately measure your waist circumference, [the CDC provides the following guidelines:](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/index.html)\\n\\n*   _“Stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones._ \\n*   _Make sure tape is horizontal around the waist_ \\n*   _Keep the tape snug around the waist, but not compressing the skin_ \\n*   _Measure your waist just after you breathe out”_ \\n\\nStaying in the healthy weight range has powerful positive effects in preventing heart disease, as well as many other medical conditions. Recommendations for reaching a healthy weight are provided later in the module.\\n\\n*   **Smoking**  \\n    We have known for decades that smoking tobacco, including cigarettes, pipe, and cigars, contributes to many significant health problems including numerous cancers, emphysema, and heart disease. While smoking rates have decreased significantly in recent years, some continue to smoke. Tobacco smoke includes many chemicals, some of which cause inflammation of the cells linking blood vessels, which narrows the blood vessels and makes them less effective in transporting blood. Smoking also causes increased plaque formation inside the walls of blood vessels. This also reduces blood flow throughout the body. When the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle become significantly narrowed or blocked, this is called coronary heart disease. This can cause gradual deterioration of heart tissue and reduce its ability to pump blood throughout the body. If a blood clot or segment of plaque blocks blood flow to the heart, this may cause a heart attack, which may be fatal. Because chemicals inhaled from tobacco cause blood to become thicker and to form clots, these blockages causing coronary heart disease and heart attack are significantly more common among smokers. The risk of heart conditions increases with smoking frequency; smoking two packs per day is significantly more damaging to the heart than smoking a half pack per day. However, smoking even small daily amounts of tobacco significantly increases the risk of heart conditions compared with not smoking at all.", "title": "Risk Factors", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:56:57.546231+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:59:38.52963+00	\N	f

These recommendations are based on decades of research on the factors that play the most important role in determining whether someone will develop heart problems. These recommendations are summarized below. For additional resources, go to the American Heart Association diet and lifestyle recommendations, and CDC resources to prevent heart disease. \\n\\n**1\\\\. Manage your blood pressure**\\n\\nThere are many ways to reduce blood pressure, and most people can benefit from trying several or all these approaches. These include getting regular exercise, losing weight (if currently overweight), reducing sodium intake, practicing meditation and stress reduction. \\n\\n_**Exercise and Weight Loss.**_ \\n\\nGuidelines for exercise specify engaging in moderate-intensity activities that increase heart rate and breathing rate, between 3 and 6 times per week, for a target of at least 150 minutes total per week. This can include brisk walking, running, cycling, or organized fitness routines. However, even if you cannot meet this target, expert guidelines indicate that any amount of physical exercise provides some benefits in heart health. If you are not yet ready to plan scheduled exercise times, try to follow the simple principle of “[move more, sit less](https://health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/current-guidelines/top-10-things-know)”. By increasing the amount of time you are in motion, you will likely begin to lose weight as well, and the more time spent in motion, the greater the weight loss on average.\\n\\n_**Reduce Sodium.**_ \\n\\nBecause sodium promotes water retention, which increases blood pressure, reducing sodium intake is important. This includes reducing the use of table salt on food, but also trying to select foods lower in sodium content, keeping in mind that sodium is not always in the form of table salt. \\n\\n_**Meditate.**_ \\n\\nThe Cordico Wellness app includes a Mindfulness module, including a section on mindfulness meditation. Regularly practicing meditation has been associated with reduced blood pressure.\\n\\n_**Reduce Stress.**_ \\n\\nAnother Cordico Wellness app module addresses Stress Management, with several different stress-reducing exercises and practices. Managing stress more effectively can also contribute to reduced blood pressure.\\n\\n_**Blood Pressure Medications.**_ \\n\\nSeveral prescription medications are effective at reducing blood pressure. Consult with your physician about whether a blood pressure medication is right for your situation. \\n\\n**2\\\\. Control cholesterol**\\n\\nThere is a significant genetic component that influences serum cholesterol levels, and some people continue to have high cholesterol levels even if they exercise, follow a recommended diet, and maintain a healthy weight. However, there are a number of steps that can be taken to lower your cholesterol. Because of the complexity of managing cholesterol, decisions about how to manage high cholesterol readings should be made in consultation with your physician. \\n\\n_**Replacing “Bad” Dietary Fats for “Healthy” Fats.**_ \\n\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has found consistent, strong evidence that total cholesterol and “bad” LDL cholesterol can be lowered by reducing consumption of saturated fats such as beef, pork, dairy, and tropical oils, and replacing them in your diet with polyunsaturated fats such as those in olive oil, walnuts, sunflower seeds, salmon. \\n\\n**_Exercise._** \\n\\nBoth cardiovascular exercise and strength training have been shown to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and raise HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It appears that engaging in high-intensity exercise, like High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) routines, may result in even better cholesterol profiles.\\n\\n**_Medication._** \\n\\nSeveral different medications are effective in lowering cholesterol, such as statins. Given the significant cardiac risk of untreated high cholesterol, it is important to make sure that your cholesterol levels are in a healthy range. If you have persistently high cholesterol, make it a priority to consult with your physician about whether cholesterol-lowering medication would be a good choice.\\n\\n**3.** **Manage blood sugar**\\n\\nIf you have diabetes or have been told by your physician that your blood sugar levels are high, be sure to follow your physician’s guidelines for managing your blood sugar levels. This may involve monitoring blood sugar during the day, following a customized eating schedule, taking medication, using insulin, or some combination of these measures. Keeping high blood sugar levels in check will help to keep your heart healthy and protected from harmful effects of excessive blood sugar.\\n\\n**4\\\\. **Get Active****\\n\\nIt is by now universally acknowledged that cardiovascular exercise, which can include a large range of possibility activities, is one of the most important factors in maintaining heart health. \\n\\n**_Here are the principles for heart health from the CDC, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association:_**\\n\\n**A. Get at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week.**   \\nAt moderate intensity, your heart rate will increase, and you will breathe harder, but would still be able to talk. This can include brisk walking (at least 2.5 miles per hour), biking at 10 miles per hour, gardening, or dancing. There is also strong evidence that increasing time spent in moderate exercise to 300 minutes (5 hours) per week provides even greater health benefits.\\n\\n**B. Minimize the amount of time spent sitting, even if just to move around.**   \\nSitting is sedentary behavior, and the more time spent in sedentary behavior, the poorer the effects on heart health.\\n\\n**C. Engage in moderate- to high-intensity strength training twice per week.**   \\nKeeping your muscle groups strong will help you to avoid injury and will help you to avoid weight gain. Strength training also results in greater muscle mass, which burns more calories at rest than the same amount of fat tissue. \\n\\n**D. Commit to making exercise a regular, long-term habit.**   \\nWhile some people throw themselves into an ambitious and demanding exercise routine for a few weeks or months, they may find it difficult to stay motivated to continue if too much time is required or if the activity is not enjoyable. Rather than modify their exercise routine, they may simply stop altogether. It is far better to find an exercise activity that is enjoyable, so that you will look forward to it, rather than an activity that you begin to dread and avoid. Mixing up your routine for variety can help keep you engaged. This might include scheduling brisk walks or bicycling with a friend or family member a few days a week, gardening or yard work on another day, and an exercise class or cardiovascular activity at the gym one or two days a week. \\n\\nThe American Medical Association notes that 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity can be substituted for the 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. Vigorous intensity would include running, jumping rope, bicycling faster than 10 miles per hour, playing singles tennis, or doing strenuous yard work such as continuous digging or hoeing. Recent research indicates that High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) can provide the same benefits as moderate exercise in significantly less time. High Intensity Interval Training involves running, cycling, or other aerobic exercises, with a pattern of alternating between short periods of moderate intensity (approximately 50% of maximum effort) and high intensity (85-90% of maximum effort.) There appear to be some added health benefits that may be distinct to HIIT, such as enhanced metabolic functioning, so that incorporating at least some HIIT activities into your weekly schedule would likely be beneficial.\\n\\nFor any exercise program, be sure that you are medically cleared to engage in the exercise routine. If it has been awhile since you have exercised, follow the principle of easing back into fitness, starting at a lower intensity for shorter periods of time, and then gradually working your way up in the intensity and duration of the exercise. Some people who have become out of shape seem to feel the need to punish themselves or otherwise suffer for their current state by overdoing it in the gym or on a run. They can easily end up injured, extremely sore, and demoralized, making them much less likely to return to work on their fitness goals the next day, and the day after, and so on. One of the most important features of physical activity for heart health is getting regular exercise consistently, week after week, year after year. Selecting a variety of different enjoyable exercise activities will help you to stick with regular exercise for the long haul.  \\n  \\n**5\\\\. Eat Well**Eating better does not mean depriving yourself of enjoyable foods, but instead involves eating a variety of foods, with an emphasis on healthier choices from the different food groups. The American Heart Association’s general guidelines emphasize the importance of eating a variety of different fruits and vegetables, skinless poultry and fish, whole grains, low-fat dairy products such as milk and cheese, nuts and legumes (such as pinto beans, black beans, or kidney beans) and using olive oil or other non-tropical oils.  \\n  \\nWhile no single food should be considered off-limits forever, it is important to be mindful of the amount and kinds of food you are consuming. Check the nutrition labels on foods that you buy, and notice the number of calories, grams of sugar, and amount of sodium compared with daily recommended amounts. Daily average calories needed are estimated at 1600 to 2400 for women, and 2000 to 3000 calories for men, with the lower end for sedentary behaviors and the higher end for higher activity levels. When reading food labels, keep in mind that some items may be considered to be 2 or more servings, so that calories per serving may be misleading. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to no more than 1500 mg per day. It is important to check nutrition labels on food because much of our sodium intake is from ingredients other than salt; in fact, many high-sodium foods do not taste salty. So be sure to look at nutrition labels to keep track of how much sodium you are consuming currently, and then make modifications with a goal of getting your sodium below 1500 mg (milligrams) per day.  \\n  \\nGeneral healthy eating approaches can help to reduce sodium intake, as well as sugar and other less healthy ingredients. These include limiting sugary drinks, candy, processed meats, such as sausage or salami, and other highly processed foods; and avoiding tropical oils, such as coconut or palm oil, partially hydrogenated oils, such as margarine, packaged foods, and fried foods; and avoid excess calories. Consulting the nutrition label will help you identify foods with these ingredients and can help you to estimate how many calories you are currently consuming. If you are consuming more calories than you are using, these excess calories will be stored as fat. If your current weight is higher than you would like, gathering information about your current calorie intake is a helpful step in identifying ways to reduce calories and get to a healthy weight.\\n\\nOne eating plan called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) can help maintain heart health by keeping blood pressure in a healthy range. The DASH approach also emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and foods with adequate fiber and potassium, while minimizing foods with too much sodium, cholesterol, or saturated fats. Although the serving amounts will vary depending on how many calories you burn throughout the course of a day, the American Heart Association provides the following “[Smart choices](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/suggested-servings-from-each-food-group)” guidelines for daily food intake:\\n\\n**Vegetables:** (fresh, frozen, canned, dried):  \\n5 servings or 2.5 cups\\n\\n**Fruits:** (fresh, frozen, canned, and dried)  \\n4 servings or 2 cups\\n\\n**Grains:** (at least half should be _whole grain_)  \\n6 servings or 6 ounces\\n\\n**Dairy:** (low-fat or fat-free)  \\n3 servings or 3 cups\\n\\n**Proteins:** (fish, skinless poultry, lean meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, beans and legumes \\\\[such as pinto beans, black beans, or kidney beans\\\\])  \\n2 servings or 5.5 oz.\\n\\n**Oils:** (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (3 tbsp.) _Examples of healthier cooking oils:_ Canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil. Combinations of these oils may be labeled as “vegetable oils” and are also healthier choices than tropical oils. Cooking oils to avoid or use less frequently include the tropical oils, coconut oil and palm oil, as well as lard, butter, and shortening. All of these tend to have high amounts of saturated fat, which is associated with increased risk for heart disease.\\n\\nFinally, as a general principle for eating, it is recommended that you watch the number of calories you eat and drink, cook at home, look for food labels with the Heart-Check to indicate a healthier option, and check nutrition labels for high sodium content.  \\n  \\n**6\\\\. Lose Weight**\\n\\nIf you are already at a healthy weight, that’s great! Keep up the great work and be sure to monitor your food intake and exercise activity to continue to maintain a healthy weight. With age, and changes in life circumstances such as getting married or having kids, many people find that their weight begins to creep up. If your weight is already higher than you would like, consult with your physician or with a reputable source to see what a healthy weight target would be for your height and physical frame. Healthy weight ranges, Body Mass Index (BMI), and waist circumference estimators are available online through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html) and the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm).\\n\\nThere are countless books and programs for weight loss, some of which give conflicting advice. It can be difficult to know which recommendations are likely to be most effective.\\n\\nThe following principles are from the American Heart Association, CDC, and NIH. First, make goals that are specific, doable (attainable), and forgiving. The NIH offers the following example:\\n\\n_“‘Exercise more’ is a great goal, but it's not specific. \\"Walk 5 miles every day\\" is specific and measurable, but is it doable \\\\[attainable\\\\] if you're just starting out? \\"Walk 30 minutes every day\\" is more attainable, but what happens if you're held up at work one day and there's a thunderstorm during your walking time another day? \\"Walk 30 minutes, 5 days each week\\" is specific, doable, and forgiving. In short, a great goal.”_  \\n  \\nNext, work gradually towards long-term goals by completing a series of shorter-term goals, such as increasing the number of minutes spent exercising each week. As you achieve these goals, the third principle, reward, comes into play. Reward yourself for your successes with a treat (other than food) that you enjoy. This could include giving yourself time off from household obligations or could involve going to a movie. In general, it is better to give yourself smaller, more frequent rewards rather than working weeks or months to earn a large reward.  \\n  \\nOne of the most important principles in weight loss involves Self-monitoring. This generally involves recording (a) what you eat and drink; (b) the amount you exercise; and (c) your weight. The goal is not to track closely in order to punish yourself for eating too much or exercising too little, but simply to develop an accurate, objective estimate of how many calories you are consuming, how many calories you are burning, and the effects on your weight. If you have tendencies to become excessively focused on food, weight, or physical shape, or have a history of an eating disorder such as bulimia or anorexia, then self-monitoring may not be right for you. If you have been diagnosed or treated for an eating disorder, be sure to consult with a behavioral health professional about how best to manage your weight without aggravating the eating disorder.  \\n  \\nIn general, self-monitoring should provide you with information about what you are eating, when, and how much, so that you can select high calorie foods to reduce, or identify times or activities when you are likely to overeat, such as snacking while watching TV, or staying too long at the table after dinner and continuing to eat when not actually hungry. Keeping at least an estimate of your calorie intake will allow you to compare this number with calories used during exercise. There are several online estimators for calories burned for different types of exercise, and some provide inconsistent estimates for the same exercise. However, consulting with two or more online calculators can provide at least an estimate of how many calories you are using each day. If you find that you are consuming more calories than you burn, look at whether you can change this through reducing calories, increasing exercise, or a combination of the two. Although both exercise and reducing calories are important for weight loss, there is some research support for the principle that changes in eating behavior to reduce calories may be more important than exercise. This may be due in part to the amount of time involved; it is far less time-consuming to decline to eat a 500 calorie dessert than spending the hour or so of moderate exercise needed to burn off those 500 calories.\\n\\nGetting your weight into a healthy range can have a significant impact on improving your heart health, and will likely make you feel significantly better physically. Additional resources for losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight, are available through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/losing_weight/index.html), the [NIH](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/wtl_prog.htm), and the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight/keeping-a-healthy-body-weight).  \\n  \\n**7\\\\. Stop Smoking**  \\nThe dangers of smoking are well known, as are the difficulties many people face when trying to quit. Studies have shown that most people who attempt to quit smoking relapse within a year and are back to smoking again. However, people who successfully stay quit, and stop smoking for good, tend to (a) learn from past attempts what tripped them up, and what to do differently next time; and (b) KEEP QUITTING! In other words, if they quit smoking but start up again, they begin preparing for their next attempt. By identifying what went wrong in their previous attempt, their plans for their next quitting attempt will include strategies for coping with stressors, such as a hard day at work; or with tempting situations, such as being around people who are smoking. By learning from past mistakes, they can rehearse in advance what they will do next time to respond more effectively.  \\n  \\nStrategies to quit smoking include replacing times spent smoking with a different enjoyable activity, such as going for a walk, trying a new hobby, going to a movie, or doing yard work. For many people, setting a quit day and committing to it helps make the change more concrete. For many people, quitting “cold turkey” is the most effective method. However, some people will start tapering down on the number of cigarettes per day as they work towards their quit day, with the plan that by quit day they will stop using tobacco altogether. Avoid substituting another type of tobacco product for the one you quit, such as chewing tobacco instead of cigarettes, as all tobacco products have serious harmful health consequences.  \\n  \\nKeep in mind that most former smokers made several attempts before successfully quitting for good. Estimates of the average number of attempts before success range from a low of 6 attempts, to a high of [30](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e011045). Regardless of the statistical average, the important principle for you to remember is that continuing to try to quit smoking is the best way to finally become tobacco-free. The benefit to your heart, and many other aspects of your health, will be substantial.  \\n  \\nAdditional resources for quitting smoking are available from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm), the [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/i-want-to-quit/top-tips-for-quitting-smoking), the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking-tobacco/5-steps-to-quit-smoking).", "title": "Becoming Heart Healthy", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:58:55.253657+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:59:49.094604+00	\N	f

He is working hard to learn more about and fight heart disease in law enforcement. We conducted an interview with Dr. Sheinberg and are honored to publish his article._\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/420/841986/Sheinberg245.jpg) \\n\\nAs a fellow Law Enforcement Officer and a physician I am trying to spread the word. We are missing the boat, and because of this, we are dying. There is a simple reason that law enforcement officers have some of the best pensions in the country – we do not live long enough after retirement to fully collect them. Several programs have been created to address premature officer death and officer safety is a primary concern for every agency whether on the local, state or federal level. Police officers and Special Agents are intimately aware of safety policy and procedure requirements: wear reflective vests, always use body armor, do not engage in high- speed pursuits for low-level crimes etc. Despite these efforts however, there is another cause of officer death and disability that is usually overlooked – cardiovascular disease.\\n\\n**Heart disease is a major problem for law enforcement!**\\n\\nHeart attacks are always in the top two or three categories of police line of duty deaths. However, if extrapolated to a full 24-hour day, heart attack likely becomes the number one killer of men and women in uniform. This is not new information. More than 20 years ago, International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) published some of their initial data (Violanti, 2013). The data are shocking. The life expectancy of a police officer is 20 years less than his or her civilian counterpart. The average age of a law enforcement officer (LEO) who has suffered a heart attack is 49 years, compared to 67 years of age for the general population. Finally, it is known that a LEO is twenty-five times more likely to suffer death and disability from heart disease than from a violent action of a suspect. Despite this information, many agencies have been slow to develop wellness programs and cardiac screening assessments.\\n\\nIt is now very clearly understood that the most effective treatment of coronary artery disease is prevention. With today’s technology, the understanding of nutrition and the development of certain medications, heart disease is completely detectable, preventable and even reversible. The key to this prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease is the development of a cardiovascular screening program and an overall wellness program.\\n\\nWellness is defined as the condition of good physical, mental and emotional health, especially when maintained by an appropriate diet, exercise and other lifestyle modifications. Any program that supports wellness is absolutely vital in a profession in which 80% of officers are obese (Shell et al, 2003 ). Obese police officers may at times be ineffective in their job and may place their agency in a position of increased liability. It has been seen time and time again, an “out of shape” officer may resort to deadly force more quickly than his or her physically fit counterpart, as the ability to go ”hands on” becomes less effective. Obesity isn’t a problem specific to Law Enforcement, it is a global pandemic and recently for the first time in recorded history, 30% more deaths will occur from complications of obesity than from starvation.\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/420/841986/SheinbergHeartStats.png)\\n\\nThe concept of wellness centers around nutrition. To better understand nutrition, several myths need to be dispelled. First and foremost, the biggest public health nightmare in the last 50 years arose from the 1983 United States guidelines recommending a reduction of fat in the American diet from 40% to 30% of calories consumed. The results have been catastrophic and have resulted in the obesity pandemic and the associated complications of obesity such as the increase in type II diabetes and the increase in cardiovascular disease. In 1983, an inaccurate concept was presented: dietary fat consumption results in heart disease. It was thought that dietary consumption of fat raised Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL – or bad cholesterol). LDL causes heart disease therefore dietary fat causes heart disease. This is simply not true. Although dietary fat does raise the bad cholesterol, it raises a type of bad cholesterol which is actually not that bad after all. Fat consumption results in an LDL particle that is buoyant or “fluffy”. These large, fluffy particles pass directly through the blood stream and are cleared by the liver. They are not absorbed into the blood vessel walls, and therefore do not contribute to arterial blockage formation. In contradistinction to this, when carbohydrates or sugar are eaten, the body produces a type of bad cholesterol which is truly bad. These cholesterol particles are small and dense (think golf balls vs. beach balls) and therefore have the ability to cross the cell lining of the blood vessels and collect in the coronary artery wall. This is how plaque (and eventually coronary disease) develops. It is therefore essential to understand that it is in fact carbohydrates and sugar that results in heart disease, not fat. It is now understood as fact that bread, rice, pasta, juice, soda, tortilla and such cause the development of bad dense LDL particles and therefore the development of heart disease. The concept of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and meat is the basis of the “Paleo” or caveman diet. This diet of low carbohydrate consumption is not only vital to cardiac health but to overall general wellness.\\n\\n**It’s a perfect storm and it’s not your fault…**\\n\\nOur bodies are not designed to eat carbohydrate laden processed food. However the deck is stacked against us. Sugar, wheat and corn are subsidized by the federal government and therefore inexpensive. Processed food is readily available and packaged for ease of consumption. Finally, this type of food tastes good and it is addictive. It is a well-understood marketing tool that the more sugar a manufacture places in the food, the more it is consumed. The combination of inaccurate guidelines, subsidization, processing and the adding of sugar to improve taste – has resulted in the biggest public health crisis in the last 50 years, that is obesity, diabetes and progressive heart disease.\\n\\n**We are not powerless…**\\n\\nIn order to turn back the tide of obesity, diabetes and heart disease the physiology of obesity needs to be examined and understood. Obesity is not simply a bad behavior, it is a problem of biochemistry. \\n\\nWhen hungry, the stomach secretes a hormone called ghrelin. This peptide reaches the brain and tells the brain its time to eat. After eating has begun, the fat tissue receives nutrients and a hormone called leptin is released. This leptin travels to the brain and activates the nervous system resulting in the “sugar high”. The brain knows it has food available and therefore it’s okay to expend energy. However, when an individual is overweight, his or her body’s insulin levels are elevated. The elevated insulin present in the body blocks the leptin and the brain does not know it has been fed. In essence, those with elevated insulin levels have brains that think they are “starving”. In this situation, the brain attempts to decrease the body’s metabolism, hold onto every calorie and does not “encourage” exercise. This works great if one is starving. But for the majority – it backfires; it creates obesity.\\n\\nThis cycle CAN be broken! By simply removing the sugar from the diet, the body’s insulin level will decrease and the brain will once again recognize leptin. Weight loss occurs rather quickly. Therefore, the rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease can be radically reduced by simply eliminating sugar and reducing carbohydrates from the diet.\\n\\n**Early detection is key!**\\n\\nSCREENING is defined as the “examination of a group to separate well persons from those who have an undiagnosed pathologic condition or who are at high risk”. In other words, how can a population of police officers who have been historically at high risk for premature heart disease be evaluated to identify those individuals who are likely to develop heart attacks before they have their first problem?\\n\\nIn order to help answer this question, The Public Safety Cardiac Foundation (PSCF) was created. This foundation is a 501 (c) 3 not-for-profit entity, developed to obtain grant funding to sponsor cardiovascular research and promote cardiovascular screening within law enforcement agencies. The PSCF has already created Cardiac Screening Initiative (CSI), a pilot study that has made some significant headway in developing strategies to help in the early detection of heart disease in police officers. The CSI evaluated police officer volunteers who were not having any symptoms. These officers were asked to perform three very simple screening tests: an exercise treadmill test, a coronary calcium score CT scan (a low dose radiation CAT scan designed to detect the small flecks of calcium present in blockages) and an advanced blood test. The advanced blood test (Boston Heart Diagnostic Lab) was performed to look at the presence of different types of cholesterol particles and the presence of a maker of coronary inflammation, which would suggest the early development of blockage. This inflammatory biomarker, phospholipase associated appoprotein 2, (PLA-2) is an enzyme that is released by the heart’s blood vessels in response to blockage formation. This process is similar to the inflammation that occurs after getting a splinter. The results of the study so far have been absolutely staggering. Of the officers screened to date, 54% have detectable coronary disease.\\n\\n**Save lives, save money!**\\n\\nBy detecting coronary disease in its earliest stages and before it causes symptoms, it is possible to not only save officer lives, but to keep officers on the street and reduce their agency expenses. Due to the high costs of health care, it is estimated that aggressive screening for heart disease can save approximately $5000 per officer per year when extrapolated across a large department. Also, considering that after coronary artery bypass surgery, a heart attack or a stent placement/angioplasty there are significant amounts of time that officer will be off the job, requiring increased overtime for the remainder of the officers. This cost is ultimately passed along to the tax payers.\\n\\nThe responsibility for officer wellness and screening lies within the training academy, the agency and the individual officer or agent. Initially, the training academy must set the tone and establish the concept that wellness is an important component of law enforcement. Just as graduates currently understand that they will be required to maintain proficiency with their weapons, they should also have the expectations that they will be required to maintain physical fitness and weight standards. Individual agencies must also develop a degree of accountability within its ranks, using either the “stick or carrot” approach or any combination of thereof. Agency fitness standards cannot be created in a vacuum, but instead, need to be developed with collaboration between command staff, departmental physicians, union representatives, fitness professionals and training directors. Finally, it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual officer or special agent to understand their increased risk for coronary disease and seek out possible screening and wellness programs, even if they are not offered by their specific agency. It is quite clear that obesity, diabetes and coronary disease are major factors that contribute to premature police officer death and disability. It is absolutely vital that law enforcement agencies recognize this risk and develop wellness and screening programs to keep their officers healthy, effective and safe.

The end result is not only taxing on the officer's life, but expensive for taxpayers. \\"For an officer that has a heart attack, that costs the tax payers about $750,000,\\" Sheinberg said. \\"It is medical costs, its time off that other officers have to fill with overtime its premature retirement its disability.\\"\\n\\nDepartments should also create fitness program rewarding officers who stay in shape and live healthy lifestyles. \\"We have significant budgetary problems here's the money,\\" Sheinberg said. \\"We can keep people on the job, healthy without early retirement and disability and reduce overtime if we do this stuff up front.\\"\\n\\nSheinberg is preparing to present his findings to the Department of Justice.

By identifying the routine, you're in a position to observe the habit loop, which in turn empowers you to replace an unhealthy habit with a healthy habit. For example, imagine you have an unhealthy habit of watching five hours of TV before bed each night. This habit has led to you being inactive, not returning phone calls from friends, ignoring household chores, staying up too late, and having difficulty falling asleep. Although you've tried to avoid watching too much TV each evening, you find yourself parked in front of the TV again night after night, watching reruns of old sit-coms while neglecting your responsibilities, leading to feelings of guilt and eroding your sense of self-efficacy. \\n\\n**Key Point:** Fortunately, routines are often easy to identify because they consist of your actions; specifically, those very behaviors that you wish to change. In this example of watching too much TV, the routine consists simply of turning on the TV each evening and watching it until you fall asleep. \\n\\nOnce you've identified the routine, it's important to dig deeper and isolate the cue for the routine. Ask yourself: What is the trigger that leads to the execution of this routine? Is it that you feel bored (and the TV provides some light entertainment)? Is it that you're physically tired but not yet ready to fall asleep (and the TV provides an excuse to relax)? Perhaps you're mentally exhausted (and the TV is a means for mentally checking out)? Or maybe you're seeking to escape the burden of more demanding tasks (and watching TV is the easiest option available)? \\n\\nThe other important question to address is: What is the reward? Here, it's important to ask yourself: What is reinforcing this routine for me, so that it keeps persisting? Is it the entertainment associated with watching certain TV shows? Is it the physical relaxation of lying on the couch? Is it the mental escape at the end of a demanding workday? Or is it the avoidance of potentially more demanding activities such as yard work, home repairs, cleaning, organizing, or paying bills?", "title": "Step One: Identify the Routine", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 22:08:16.635467+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:56:25.79828+00	\N	f

One of the best ways to start, according to Duhigg, is to wait until you feel the urge to engage in the routine, and then respond to that urge by doing something different than the normal routine. If you're working to change the habit of watching too much TV, for example, you'll wait until you feel the urge to turn on the TV, and then, instead of turning on the TV you'll do something different. The key is to choose alternatives that are not unhealthy or harmful, but otherwise to experiment with a variety of options. You might try chatting with a friend (try friends you know from work and also friends from outside of work), calling someone on the phone to catch up, meeting a friend for dinner, going to the gym, going for a walk, reading a book, planning a vacation, meditating, cleaning up your garage, taking on a new project, and so on. You can come up with a lot of great options, and this will help you gather important information.\\n\\nAs you vary your routine, you're giving yourself the opportunity to test different ideas regarding what drives the habit loop. Each time you do something other than your normal habit routine, you're running an experiment. You're gathering information, much like a detective or a scientist, that will help you to discover the truth, and once you know what's actually driving your habit loop, you'll be empowered to make changes.\\n\\nThere are a couple of other tricks that can help you, according to Duhigg, as you experiment with rewards by altering your routine. Remember, the key here is to ultimately determine what you are craving because that way you'll know what's driving your habit loop. Each time you try a new routine, one trick is to take a pen and paper and write down a few of the feelings you're experiencing or thoughts that come to mind as you complete the new activity. Next, wait for fifteen minutes (setting a timer is helpful with this step) and then ask yourself if you're still craving the old routine (e.g., TV). Waiting for fifteen minutes is important because it helps you determine if your new activity satisfied the craving for the old routine. For example, if meditating for thirty minutes helps stave off mental exhaustion, and fifteen minutes after meditating you no longer have the urge to watch TV, then you've successfully identified that mental exhaustion was leading you to crave watching TV. Writing down a few of your thoughts and feelings after each new activity is helpful in case you need to dig deeper to uncover your craving. For example, imagine that you finish meditating, you then write down your thoughts and feelings, and fifteen minutes later you're craving TV. At that point, you examine what you wrote down, and you read: \\"I feel bored\\" and \\"I'm relaxed.\\" These notes now serve as powerful data, because they reveal that while you found meditation to be relaxing, you felt bored. Therefore, when you found yourself still craving TV, it wasn't to satisfy a need for relaxation, but for stimulation.\\n\\n**Key Point:** By taking the time to experiment with different rewards, you'll eventually be able to determine the specific craving that drives your habit loop.", "title": "Step Two: Experiment with Rewards", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	ee3e05f4-6db5-4ef5-9c28-9664020c920f	2021-09-24 22:08:55.298168+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:56:38.00514+00	\N	f

Identifying the routine turned out to be easy - it consisted of turning on the TV and watching it until we fell asleep.\\n\\nExperimenting with rewards, we discovered that meditating for twenty minutes and then engaging in another activity (anything engaging - from spending time with friends to exercising at the gym) caused us to no longer experience the craving to watch TV. Working to isolate the cue, we determined that coming home to an empty house at the end of a long day served to activate our TV craving. Based on all of this information, we can write up a plan. In this example, the plan might look like this: \\n\\nI'll make a list of healthy and engaging activities that I'd like to do more frequently (examples might include jogging, playing an instrument, spending more time with friends, or learning a new language).\\n\\nWhen I come home to an empty house at the end of a long day, I'll meditate for twenty minutes then I'll choose an activity from my new list and do that instead of watching TV. It might be challenging at first to make the shift. Old habits can be hard to break. But your chances of dropping an unhealthy habit and replacing it with a new healthy routine are enhanced when you understand the dynamics driving your old habit, as this allows you to engineer change that will address the underlying cravings driving the old behavioral pattern. In the TV example, it turns out that two factors were driving the old routine: 1) mental exhaustion and 2) boredom. So, the solution was to target mental exhaustion with twenty minutes of meditation, and then to target the boredom with a variety of healthy activities that can vary according to your needs and preferences.", "title": "Step Four: Have a Plan   ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 22:10:12.9547+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:57:01.476999+00	\N	f

You can also reduce a problem behavior by reinforcing essentially any other behavior. If a child has been throwing tantrums, you can praise them anytime they are not having a tantrum (e.g., “I like how you are keeping your voice quiet”) even if the behavior is not the positive opposite. Perhaps surprisingly, you can even give reinforcement simply for doing the undesirable behavior less frequently. For example, if a child has been getting angry with his siblings every 5 minutes, a parent could praise them immediately after getting angry later by saying, “I’m really glad that you went 15 minutes without getting angry! You really acted like a big kid!” This calls attention to the desired behavior, reinforces growth, changes the direction of the parent’s attention to positive, and often stops negative behavior in its tracks.\\n\\nKey Points for Using Reinforcers:\\n\\n*   Provide the reinforcer immediately after the desired behavior when possible.\\n*   Say exactly what the behavior is that earned the reinforcer.\\n*   Use a high-quality reinforcer (enthusiastic praise; enough points to quickly earn reward for new behavior).\\n*   Start by reinforcing every time the behavior occurs at first, then fade.\\n\\nUsing Punishment\\n\\nMany parents are skeptical when child “experts” say that punishment is not as effective as reinforcement for changing behavior. Parents are concerned that their children will become “spoiled” or always “need a prize.” However, research repeatedly shows that punishment is both less effective than reinforcement at producing positive behavior changes, and that punishment has negative effects on the child and on the parent-child relationship that reinforcement does not cause.\\n\\nAlthough it should be far outweighed by the use of reinforcement through parental attention and praise, there can be a role for punishment. The most widely accepted form of punishment is a time-out, in which the child is cutoff from enjoyable activities or other reinforcers, including parental attention. If you assign a time-out, it can be quite brief – 1-2 minutes of time-out is just as effective as 10 minutes of time-out, and going beyond 10 minutes actually starts to weaken the effectiveness of the time-out. Excessive punishments are unhelpful, are usually more about the parent’s emotions, and harm the parent-child relationship. The best practice is to provide a brief time out to specifically reinforce this is a known unwanted behavior (drawing on the wall, striking a sibling, jumping on furniture), followed by having the child take responsibility for the behavior, and immediately redirecting their behavior towards the desired behavior and praise. \\n\\nKey Points for Using Punishment \\n\\n*   Focus primarily on reinforcing the positive opposite of a problem behavior, through parental attention, praise, or a point chart. \\n*   If you use punishment make sure that it is not excessive, and drives children towards the desired behavior. \\n*   For time-out punishments for younger children, don’t interact with them for the 1-2 minutes that they are in time-out, as your attention is a form of reinforcement.\\n\\nSummary of Managing Children’s Behavior\\n\\nIt can be a challenge to set limits and develop good behavior in your child while still maintaining a close, loving connection with them. By keeping an eye out all the time for the positive, desirable behaviors that your child is doing, and reinforcing it with praise and attention, you can increase the behaviors that are important for your child’s development, while at the same time adding more and more instances of positive experiences and positive emotions linking you and your child. If there is a problem behavior, try to identify what the “positive opposite” of that behavior is, and reinforce it with praise and attention, and with a point chart if necessary. If you use punishment, time-out from enjoyable activities is the most effective and least risky form of punishment. Time-outs should be brief, and mild; harsher punishments for longer durations do not work better, and usually have negative side effects. The more you can rely on using your praise and attention to shape your child's behavior, the more likely you will build: a stronger parent-child relationship; a more positive relationship; a more competent child; and, a more self-confident child.", "title": "Reducing Problem Behaviors ", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:22:21.124812+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:22:21.124812+00	\N	f

These routines include establishing structure to the day, good communication, developing positive connections with family, strengthening appropriate social behaviors, and staying consistently aware of your child’s whereabouts. \\n\\n**Providing Structure**\\n\\nEstablishing everyday routines have an enormous impact on the emotional and social well-being of your children. Extensive research shows that having a set time and order for daily activities (chores, snack, dinner, homework, bath, reading, bedtime) creates a framework of safety and predictability for your children. Although they will continually ask you for opportunities to break from the framework (stay up late, skip chores), maintaining the framework actually leads to positive growth and development and children who don’t have the structure of daily routines achieve less, are more emotional, and more likely to have negative relationships. \\n\\n**Communicating with Your Children**\\n\\nAlthough parenting involves spending a lot of time providing guidance and boundaries for your children, one of the most rewarding parts of being a parent is deepening your relationship with your children over time. Establishing good communication early on will help you to become closer, and to protect your relationship when difficulties arise. Although many parents tell their children, “You can talk to me about anything,” Dr. Kazdin emphasizes it is more important to demonstrate this by your actions. This includes simply listening, thoughtfully and patiently, to your child’s ideas and opinions. To clarify what is meant by “listening,” I will quote Dr. Kazdin directly: “If you’re waiting for your child to stop talking so you can correct her misconceptions, that’s a pretty good definition of not listening.” Try simply taking in what your child is communicating, noticing what their experience is like. Set aside the impulse to correct or challenge what your child says – there is plenty of time for that – and simply listen to what the world looks like through their eyes. Asking your child to tell you more about their experiences, and letting them know that you are glad they shared with you. Part of communication involves you sharing as well. As you do so, try shifting the pattern from taking turns talking, to taking turns listening. \\n\\n**Strengthen Connections in the Family**\\n\\nDeveloping and following routines helps to make life more orderly and predictable, but family rituals help to make your family yours. This might include going to the park on Saturdays, a special breakfast on Sunday mornings, or board game nights once a month with the whole family. These activities don’t need to be exceptionally joyful or expensive. You can interact while taking care of weekly chores, taking pride in making contributions to an active and warm household. You can focus on activities that grow a storehouse of warm, affectionate memories with family members. Take a moment to think of what regular errands, task, or enjoyable activities you could easily schedule regularly with your children. This could be weekly grocery shopping, walking the dog, shooting hoops – or annual events, like planting flowers for the Spring, or raking leaves into a big pile. Following rituals and routines such as these creates a shared pool of memories that can help to connect and unify your family over the years. \\n\\n**Encourage Appropriate Social Behaviors**\\n\\nYou can help your child grow into a more effective and well-adjusted adult by looking for opportunities to strengthen positive social behaviors. This includes important skills such as playing nicely with other children, sharing, being sensitive to others, and cooperating with other children and adults. Many parents focus on developing their children’s academic or athletic skills – and these certainly are important. However, children who engage in more positive social behaviors are also more likely to do well in school, and to avoid behaviors that would get them into trouble. As a result, researchers are emphasizing the importance of developing positive social behaviors as preparation for succeeding in school, and later on in careers. As described in earlier sections, it is most helpful to give positive reinforcement when your child shows positive social behaviors. Reinforcing their practice of these behaviors will help strengthen them; making them more likely to continue to occur, and helping the child turn behaviors into regular habits.\\n\\nYour child will often show a combination of positive and negative behaviors in the same situation. When this occurs, try to reinforce the positive social behaviors by commenting – “You’re sharing with your friend” – or praising – “great job being so kind to your sister.” Look for chances to praise your child for the positive social behaviors (sharing, being supportive or encouraging, being considerate), even when they are mixed in with unwanted behaviors.\\n\\nIf you find that negative behaviors are occurring repeatedly, figure out what the positive opposite of that behavior would be, and reinforce this with praise. \\n\\n**Balance Consistency with Flexibility**\\n\\nFollowing a routine most of the time helps reduce uncertainty and unpredictability, which makes everyone generally calmer. Following routines must be balanced with a good dose of flexibility. Rigidly adhering to a routine at all costs, rather than bending the routine to allow for special circumstances, can introduce more tension. When trying to establish guidelines for positive family life, it is important to seek a “just right” balance between flexibility and boundaries. While it is important to establish and maintain high standards for your children’s behavior, it is also valuable for deepening your relationship that you listen attentively to your child’s perspective, and include this input in family decisions. Particularly for issues that will not be harmful, it can be helpful to compromise and allow requests that you may not prefer (e.g., dyed hair). Doing so gives more credibility and authority when you take a strong position on issues that involve long-term negative consequences (such as teen smoking). \\n\\n**Keep Track of Your Child’s Whereabouts**\\n\\nFinally, part of the family routine should involve monitoring your child’s whereabouts and activities. When parents know where their teenagers are, the teens are much less likely to use illegal drugs, engage in risky sexual behavior, or other potentially harmful behaviors. Monitoring includes knowing where your child is, who they are with, and what adult is in charge. It does not require that you check on them every 5 minutes or that you become a helicopter parent. Instead, it strikes a healthy balance between increasing independence for your child, with firm, consistent boundaries that keep them safe. \\n\\n**Summary of Family Life**\\n\\nYour years with your child will go by quickly. Make the most of your time with them by establishing simple but consistent family routines. This will help keep things predictable in the home, and will allow opportunities to store up an ever-growing bank of affectionate memories of shared family experiences. Remembering to take turns listening with your children that will ensure that you hear and appreciate their experiences, without reflexively waiting to correct or instruct them. And knowing where they are, and who they are with, will help them to avoid trouble and stay safe. It will also let them know how very important they are to you.", "title": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:26:06.766581+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:26:06.766581+00	\N	f

The average person does not possess the courage, capabilities, or inner strength required to deal with what law enforcement sees and experiences daily. The average person is not willing to engage the most dangerous individuals, respond to the most high-risk situations, or run towards shots fired. Yet that is precisely what those who serve and protect our communities do, and they do it in service of those they have never met, to protect the lives of people whose names they do not know.\\n\\nAttacks on police have surged recently, but law enforcement officers have long been victims of assault, with 552,222 officers assaulted from 2009 to 2018, including 21,954 firearm assaults on officers, and another 90,549 assaults on officers with a knife or other dangerous weapon. Even worse, those who serve and protect are sometimes purposefully targeted for a deadly ambush, and these devastating incidents become seared into our hearts and minds for all time. We will never forget the officers ambushed in Compton, Dallas, and countless other locations forever marked by these attacks. Ambushes and other acts of targeted violence directed at law enforcement can leave those who serve and protect very understandably anxious, worried, and fearful of being the next target; this is a natural consequence of both human empathy and prioritizing officer safety. As thousands of agencies nationwide work to maintain citizen safety while their leaders strive to support civil discourse and trust in law enforcement, frontline workers suffer waves of negative emotions, accusations, and judgments.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**_“Those who serve and protect form the foundation of our safe, civil, and just society; when they are attacked, we are all forever changed.”_** \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThis article summarizes a set of recommendations for law enforcement seeking to cope with the stress and fear of being purposefully targeted for ambush and other unprovoked attacks. Many of these principles are applicable not just to fears of being ambushed or otherwise physically attacked, but also to much broader concerns about being vilified as a profession, feeling unsupported, experiencing verbal attacks, overt disrespect, and the chronic stressors associated with law enforcement work in general. \\n\\nMany police psychologists, law enforcement experts, and other resources were consulted in preparing this article. Still, not all recommendations will be a good fit for all individuals, so please rely upon your own best judgment when deciding which recommendations you choose to utilize.", "title": "Introduction", "summary": "", "videoUrl": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/448356293", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-27 21:06:09.94915+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:14:17.367795+00	\N	f

Breath control is a technique for limiting, or regulating, the stress response, and with practice can be utilized to promote physical and mental relaxation whether stress levels are high, moderate, or low. To practice this technique, exhale the air fully from your lungs then pause before taking in a full, deep breath, relaxing your abdomen as you do so. Pause briefly, and then slowly and fully exhale the breath. Practice this for several breaths.

We work more effectively, interact more positively, and experience life more richly when we are experiencing these states. However, most people do not spend every waking moment filled with these emotions, and it is unrealistic to expect that we can do so. Negative emotions are an inevitable part of life. Negative emotions can help to organize our behaviors appropriately, as when anxiety helps to focus our attention and give us increased energy when there is danger. However, many people unnecessarily experience more negative emotions and fewer positive emotions than they would like. For example, continually worrying about unlikely future dangers can sap energy, disturb sleep, distract attention away from more relevant topics, and create an exaggerated sense of dread and apprehension. Emotional health is reduced when our thoughts are unrealistically negative, when we haven't developed good strategies for managing emotions, and when we overlook positive aspects of our lives. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/Emotional_Health_Brain_2002.png)\\n\\nThe information provided in this module is intended as a helpful resource for enhancing emotional health.

Perfect practice makes perfect.\\" Elite performers bring deep focus and concentration to their training. They rarely simply go through the motions while practicing, but are fully engaged and fully present: they are observing, correcting, and calibrating their performance, bringing it ever closer to perfection. This usually requires freedom from distraction: top performers will arrange their training environment so that distractions such as TV, noise, and cell phones are excluded. Depending on your training goals, you may want to create an environment where you can practice skills, or study training materials away from noise or interruption.\\n\\nIf you are aiming for peak performance, it will be important to anticipate any distractions that may intrude, and take steps to minimize them. Many highly successful people have recognized that the quality of their decisions and their work suffers when they attempt to multitask. When feasible, make the choice to avoid multitasking. High performers attempt to do exactly one thing at a time, completing the task with their full attention before moving to the next task. While many people believe they can complete more work if they multitask, research indicates that people tend to complete less work in total when they multitask, compared to when they work on one task at a time. Even worse, the quality of multitasked work is poorer. The take away message is that you will be far more effective if you fully engage in a single task that you are either training for or completing as part of work. The work will be of a higher quality, and you will likely get even more work done.\\n\\nAs a practical matter, it probably cannot be stressed often enough that cellphones are a major distractor, even when they are not being used. Simply having a cellphone nearby can distract attention away from a task; when a notification signal goes off, many people find it nearly impossible to resist checking it out. If you want to focus deeply on training or work, try putting your phone in a different room; \\"out of sight\\" can keep the distracting cellphone \\"out of mind.\\"", "title": "Perfecting Practice", "summary": "If you want to be more effective, focus on one thing at a time, and avoid distractions.", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:12:31.047873+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 19:48:38.165754+00	\N	f

People with a growth mindset believe that if they persist in trying to master new skills, and to learn challenging material, they will eventually be successful. In contrast, people who hold a \\"fixed abilities\\" mindset tend to view abilities and intelligence as being relatively stable. In their mind, if something is too difficult, they are not smart enough (or fast enough, or talented enough) to do it. They feel that making mistakes in trying some new skill will expose the limits of their abilities.  As a result, they are less likely to try new activities that may be challenging. On the other hand, those with a growth mindset don't mind making errors or failing on their first attempts, because they hold the belief that their abilities will improve the more they challenge them. They assume that if they keep working at something, they will eventually master it. Which kind of person would you predict to reach higher levels of performance and abilities over time? By a large margin, it is those with the growth mindset. If you approach your job and your training with the attitude that mistakes and failure experiences are steps on the road to improvement and mastery (the growth mindset), you will be more likely to continue to strive for higher levels of performance, and to seek out new opportunities for improvement. \\n\\nTake a moment to reflect on whether you have more of a growth mindset, or a fixed abilities mindset. If you are inclined towards the fixed abilities mindset, consider how you could expand your abilities and skills if you open yourself up to the idea that continual improvement and mastery are possible with practice.

Physical fitness tests, full psychological testing and interviews from psychologists, academies that push them to extremes mentally and physically, background checks calling individuals from their past to hear about prior relationships and mistakes they may have made. Intense to say the least. They pass all those tests, make the commitment to serve and protect, and then they can be very ill prepared for the impacts the nature of their work may have on their health, wellness, and relationships.\\n\\nBy now many of us officer spouses have seen first-hand or have heard about some of the very serious negative impacts a career can have on a correctional officer and their relationships. Correctional officers in general have higher rates of PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation than the general population. They develop higher rates of cardiac issues and sleep disorders. Their personalities can slowly shift into a more safety conscious, negative, distrustful, or isolating version of themselves. They might lack the tools to deal effectively with such challenges which can lead to an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, struggling relationships with family members, and a sedentary lifestyle. It can be really hard to prepare correctional officers for the potential negative impacts because this can be a gradual often unnoticeable decline. Whether or not you are seeing signs of any of this or you’re just interested in preventing them from occurring, here are 5 tips for a correctional officer spouse to try and help the officer beat the impacts.\\n\\n**Be Proactive When It Comes to Personal Life**\\n\\nPlan things… even when they might get ruined! The job and the schedule take over our personal lives and they will continue to do so if we let it. If we wait for the right time, when life is less crazy, or when they feel up for it, things may NEVER happen. Then suddenly we’re bored with life and one another. New and fun experiences together help boost our mood and relationships. Maybe it’s a family trip or just a date night out. Put it in the calendar early! Schedule things, many things, and plan on them. Advice: Discuss and make plans maybe on a day off when there is little stress and you’re both in a good mood. After work, or in the middle of the work week, I expect their fatigue, adrenaline dumps from the job, and the potentially horrible things they saw at work to get in the way of any potential excitement or energy. Maybe they don’t jump for joy to head out the door to try that new restaurant you agreed on last month. Try not to take that personal if possible. That doesn’t mean they do not love you or want to spend time with you. Do it anyway! Hopefully, things make a shift once you arrive.\\n\\n**Help Them Make Time for Non-Work-Related Activities**\\n\\nOur daily experiences shape our outlook on the world. Which of course means the daily experiences that correctional officers encounter on shift will have a pretty big impact on their outlook on the world. They can commonly develop a more cautious, negative, and distrustful approach to the world. Of course, what they encounter is all real life, the problem is the imbalance of how many bad things they see in relation to how often those things occur on average for the general population. It can be a pretty dark skewed version of the world. The best way to try and counterbalance that is to try and limit more negativity and to connect them to people and activities that bring out more positivity. This can get harder and harder as the years go on. Now of course having support from other correctional officers that “get it” is great too. But try and encourage the continued connection to those people and hobbies they once loved prior to becoming a correctional officer or new ones they are interested in as a way for them to escape some of what comes along with the job.  \\n\\n**Support Healthy Habits**\\n\\nWe know a lot of health-related issues result from stress. Correctional officers endure significant amounts of stress related to their work. There is the departmental stress, likely the stuff you hear most complaints about. In addition, they physically put their body through interesting highs and lows. Our bodies aren’t necessarily meant to be calm (having a conversation and eating lunch) then suddenly thrown into emergency situations where life is at risk, then back to calm and so on. Yet they do this for years. You can see why it can take such a toll on their body. We know that there are ways we can help our bodies cope with stress though! That’s healthy habits. They need it more than the average individual to fight all the significant impacts. You can help make family time active, or make time in their day to hit the gym and de-stress. Maybe meal prepping to plan more healthy lunches and dinners would be helpful.\\n\\n**Encourage More Sleep**\\n\\nFatigue has such a great impact on correctional officers and their family members. They often work many more hours than the average individual. Like discussed earlier, their job places physical and mental stress on them in ways that can increase fatigue. Many of them work odd hours.  On top of that, there can be times when they are held over beyond what you might imagine, there is forced O.T. that interrupt the days they should be catching up on sleep. It’s really easy to acquire sleep debt as a correctional officer. We know sleep impacts so many aspects of our life and health long-term. Daily it can look like irritability, short tempered, lack of energy, disengaged, nodding off. When possible encourage them catching up on sleep with naps or full nights versus using caffeine to keep them going.  \\n\\n**Be Aware of How Much Is Too Much**\\n\\nIf we know that time on at work can have short and long-term impacts on a correctional officer’s health and wellness, it’s important to pay attention to how much time they are putting in and how much is too much. Do they still have a balanced life outside of work? Are the two of you still able to find time for one another? Have a discussion about why they are working so much? Is it temporary? Yes, certain points in the career can require more of them such as training/ probation or new assignments. Is it the family’s financial situation? Are there changes the family can make to cut down on bills in order to require less of them at work or does it make sense for two incomes as a way to allow them more balance? Basically, I am recommending you constantly assess and discuss how much time is actually being spent at work and weigh it against the costs and come to a compromise that everyone is comfortable with.\\n\\nObviously, easier said than done… but so important to try and help our correctional officers beat the impacts of this career. They deserve it and you do too! If it’s overwhelming to tackle on your own, get help making a plan for your family. Remember that plans work best when put in place before things are hard and having negative impacts. Yet it’s never too late to get help.\\n\\nAdapted from Dr. Rachelle Zemlok article.

These include _avoidance_ behaviors, such as calling in sick at work, backing out of social activities or family events, and not talking about the event with others. Other changes include increased use of alcohol or other substances, either for their calming effects, to get to sleep, or to distract away from distressing thoughts about the event. This can quickly develop into a serious problem. If you find yourself, or a colleague, using alcohol much more after a critical incident, right now is the time to take steps to be back in charge of alcohol use, and to find more effective ways of coping.\\n\\nSelf-blame is also common after critical incidents, based on the belief that something could have been done differently to prevent or lessen the critical incident. It involves the belief that if only you had done this instead of that, or if only you had reacted more quickly, you could have stopped the terrible event. Although it is very common to think of things you might have done differently in a situation, it is useful to remember that most situations involve many different factors, and it may be impossible to know with certainty the best thing to do in a dangerous, unpredictable situation.\\n\\nWatch also for recurring thoughts such as doubts about your abilities, your courage, or your resilience. Although nearly everyone feels fear and has strong physical reactions when in danger, those who are less affected by critical incidents are those who accept these responses as normal and do not judge themselves for having these responses. If you find yourself thinking, \\"I cracked under pressure,\\" because you felt fear and your heart raced and you hesitated in a crisis situation, it is worth examining these ideas more closely. Negative self-talk can become a distraction. If you find yourself having recurrent negative thoughts, consider contacting your agency's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or scheduling an appointment with a behavioral health provider to get a clearer picture of these thoughts, and how you might be able to modify your thinking to keep you at your best.", "title": "Looking for Symptoms of Critical Incident Stress", "summary": "In the days and weeks after a critical incident, some people experience changes that can become problematic if left unchecked.

This feels especially true when we are trying to balance family time and holiday traditions with our work schedules. Correctional jobs do not slow down or stop for the holidays. Often this time of year can feel even more hectic behind the secured perimeter and within our community-based correctional programs, which makes it that much more important to create some level of balance in our personal lives.\\n\\nHere are 5 tips to help you balance your family time with your work schedule during the holiday season.\\n\\n**Tip 1: Make a Plan**\\n\\nThe holidays have a way of showing up before we are ready for them, so it is important that we plan ahead. Take time to look at and discuss your schedule with your family. Which holidays will you be home? Which holidays will you be at work? Once you know what your schedule is, you can plan for how and when you will celebrate the holidays at home. To reduce some of the holiday stress pick a date (even if it is not the actual holiday calendar date), mark your calendar and plan accordingly so you and your family will be ready to celebrate it together.\\n\\n**Tip 2: Include your Family in the Planning Process**\\n\\nIt is going to be difficult to find balance and reduce stress during the holidays if you are trying to do everything by yourself. Instead, include your family in the planning process. Communicate with your partner or spouse, with your kids, and with your extended family members and friends. Let them know that your holidays may look a little different. Ask them what they would like to do and if they have any ideas on how to celebrate around your work schedule. \\n\\nIncluding your family in the planning process, being clear about what your work schedule looks like and having open conversations will allow everyone to know what is going on. This will not only reduce holiday disappointment, but it can increase excitement and positive energy around the alternative plans you make together.  If you have young kids, keep them engaged in the conversations too.  Just remember you will need to find ways to include them so that they will understand what is happening.\\n\\n(I hear Santa can make special arrangements and early or late deliveries for our correctional staff families!)\\n\\n**Tip 3: Be Flexible** \\n\\nSome or our best made plans hit bumps in the road. Being flexible during the holidays will be an important component of finding balance. Your work schedule may unexpectedly change, a family member’s schedule may unexpectedly change, a holiday party may sneak up on you, or…well, you get the idea. There is always room for something new to pop up on our schedules, there is always a chance that the plans we made will need to be adjusted.\\n\\nBeing flexible and willing to adapt to these changes as they come will help reduce stress and maintain the integrity of your family traditions. When surprises pop up, re-group with your family and adjust your plan. Remember that not all holidays have to be celebrated on a specific calendar day, instead focus on a day when everyone is home and can enjoy spending the time together.\\n\\n**Tip 4: Enjoy the Experience** \\n\\nBalance during the holidays can be difficult and as correctional staff you often need to find ways to adapt our family traditions to accommodate our work schedules. Each of the holidays have a different meaning and often a different tradition associated with them for everybody. Sometimes those traditions can be adjusted and moved around the calendar to accommodate our work schedules, sometimes they can’t. \\n\\nSince this is a reality for most correctional staff and their families, it can be helpful to focus on how you and your families will experience your holiday traditions. What do you do to celebrate the holidays? What traditions are important to you and your family? What new traditions are you looking forward to?  Is it possible to move or celebrate a specific holiday early? \\n\\nSometimes, our work schedules just won’t cooperate with our holiday traditions and not every holiday can be celebrated on a different calendar day. If you cannot move them around, maybe due to religious or spiritual reasons, then what can you do to be apart of the tradition, even if you are not able to be home with your family? \\n\\nConsider finding creative ways to enjoy the experience and be involved in the holiday traditions even when you are away. For example, have a photo of yourself seated at the table, consider making a quick video message for your family to play while you are at work, or leave a note or letter to your partner and kids to open at a specific time on the holiday. You may also consider asking your family to take photos throughout the holiday and then pick a day when you and your family are together to go through the photos. \\n\\nOur co-workers can become like family after working closely with one another. Perhaps you find coworkers who also celebrate the holiday you are missing at home and find a way to safely celebrate together at work. \\n\\n**Tip 5: Don’t Forget to Have Fun!**\\n\\nThe holiday season can be full of ups and downs. It can be difficult to be away from your family on important holidays and it is easy to get bogged down in all of the stress, the shopping, the cooking, and all of other the things we must get done in order to celebrate, all while still maintaining a busy work schedule. Remember to have fun! Enjoy those special moments at home with your family and friends and have fun while celebrating together, even when you are apart.\\n\\nAdapted from Dr. Rachelle Zemlok's article.

Simple carbohydrates are quickly digested and provide little sustained energy, but even simple carbohydrates are not all created equal. \\n\\nFor example, fruit is a simple carbohydrate, yet is energy-dense because it has important vitamins and minerals. Soda on the other hand is also a simple carbohydrate but is nutrient-empty, meaning that is provides little in terms of health or nutrient benefit. Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and usually contain fiber. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/carb_pyramid200.jpg)  \\n\\nCarbohydrates are the primary fuel source for our body. The higher the intensity of what you are doing, the greater the use of carbohydrates in the body. Because our body does not have a very large “gas tank” to store carbohydrates, our diets should contain 50-55% carbohydrates.The majority of those carbohydrates should come from complex carbohydrates and most of our simple carbohydrates should come from fruits and vegetables. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/Carbohydrates2451.jpg)  \\n\\nMost American eat too little complex carbohydrates and too many simple carbohydrates. We only have enough carbohydrates to last about 24-36 hours when we do little physical activity and 2 hours when we engage in higher intensity activities (assuming carbohydrate stores are full to start with). However, most people eat too little carbohydrates and therefore these time frames are significantly diminished. When we deplete our carbohydrate stores, our ability to engage in high intensity activities is significantly reduced. We also deny our brains from using their preferred energy source and are left feeling irritable and lethargic. If someone does not eat at least 100g of carbohydrates per day,the only way the body can get the glucose it needs is to break down protein (usually from muscle – one of the many reasons why low carbohydrate diets/high fat or high protein diets are not healthy).\\n\\n**Carbohydrates to add to your daily meal**:\\n\\n*   Fruits\\n*   Vegetables\\n*   Starchy vegetables – potatoes, yams, peas, corn\\n*   Whole Grains: brown rice, quinoa\\n*   Foods made with whole grains: bread, pastas, rice, cereals, oats\\n\\n**Eating fruits and vegetables each day will:**\\n\\n*   Aid in disease prevention\\n*   Provide body with health benefits that cannot be found in supplements\\n*   Can lead to health benefits by increasing intake by just 1 serving/day\\n\\n**Fiber should be an important component of our diet.** **Most people eat less than 30% of what the American Dietetic Association recommends each day:**\\n\\n*   Intake for females: 25g/day\\n*   Intake for males: 30g/day\\n*   For every 10g of fiber consumed/day can lead to the reduction of disease\\n*   Healthy Fiber Sources:\\n    *   Bran\\n    *   Oatmeal\\n    *   Whole grain bread\\n    *   Brown Rice\\n    *   Lentils\\n    *   Legumes (beans)", "title": "Carbohydrates", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-30 17:51:59.344952+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:22:16.727089+00	\N	f

We believe that law enforcement personnel are tactical athletes (see fitness section for more). If an athlete is to be successful, they must not only train effectively, but they also must fuel their bodies to support their activities. This principle holds true for law enforcement as well. \\n\\n  \\n\\nIt is important to determine how many calories you actually require each day. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories you burn at rest. This can also be called your metabolism. Some people burn a lot of calories at rest while others do not. While some of this is dictated by genetics, a lot of it is determined by the amount of muscle mass you have. A relatively simple way of figuring out BMR is using the Harris-Benedict equation:  \\n  \\nMen: 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years).  \\n  \\nWomen: 665 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4. x age in years).  \\n  \\nOnce you have determined your minimum calories for the day, you can figure your maximum calories by multiplying your BMR by your activity factor. This will depend on your physical activity level each day. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/2018-02-28-first-responder-fitness-tips-header200.jpg)  \\n\\nFor weight loss, multiply your BMR by 1.1;   \\nIf your goal is to maintain your current weight and you are sedentary, multiply by 1.2;   \\nIf you are lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week), multiply by 1.375;  \\nIf you are moderately active (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week), multiply by 1.5;  \\nIf you are very active (hard exercise 5-6 days/week), multiply by 1.725;   \\nIf you partake in a special forces-type training program or exercise very hard two times each day every day, multiply your BMR by 1.9. \\n\\nMost males, even law enforcement personnel who do not do extra exercise above what is required on a shift, should consider themselves lightly active.  \\n  \\nIn most cases, calories consumed in a day should never go below 1,200 for females and 1,500 for males as this will depress your metabolism and cause a troublesome starvation cycle, making it more difficult to take and keep unwanted weight off.\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/man-with-measuring-tape-around-his-waist.jpg)\\n\\nIf this equation seems too complicated, a more simple method is to track food consumption on an app such as [loseit.com](http://loseit.com) or [myfitnesspal.com](http://myfitnesspal.com). Most sedentary males should be eating approximately 1800-2000 cals/day (although these apps tend to overestimate this). Most females should be eating approximately 1600-1800 cals/day.  \\n  \\nAs mentioned previously, the higher the intensity of activity, the greater the calories burned from exercise. Activities such as fighting, grappling, chasing suspects, and jumping will result in significant carbohydrate use for energy. Thus, it is necessary to eat adequate carbohydrate daily to ensure you are up to the task.\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/shutterstock_298454666%20(1)245.jpg)  \\nTactical athletes should be eating 50-60% of their total calories in the form of carbohydrates. The type of carbohydrate matters. Whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables should make up the majority of this nutrient consumption. Simple carbohydrates such as soda, donuts or candy should be avoided as they will only result a spike in blood sugar followed quickly by feeling sluggish and hungry.\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/57373646_l2001.jpg)\\n\\nFat intake should be approximately 22-25% of total calories (see healthy plate for more details) with saturated fat less than 10% of total calories per day.  \\n  \\nProtein should only constitute 15-18 (max 20%) of total calories per day, and as mentioned in Nutrition 101, most typical Americans do not need to consume protein supplements.", "title": "Nutrition for Law Enforcement", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-30 18:02:43.573391+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:22:36.818476+00	\N	f

The FMS is best used as a filter. What are we trying to determine with this filter?  We are primarily interested in assessing pain with movement as well as the complete inability to perform a fundamental movement pattern. It is not intended to diagnose or measure isolated joint movement.\\n\\nThe purpose of the Functional Movement Screen is to:\\n\\n*   Set a movement baseline\\n*   Identify major problems with basic movement patterns\\n\\nWhat are major problems? In order of priority, they are:\\n\\n*   Pain with movement (scored as a 0 on the Functional Movement Screen)\\n*   Inability to perform a simple movement pattern even when allowed a compensation (score of a 1 on test)\\n*   Major asymmetry with movement\\n\\nThe FMS assessment is comprised of 7 movement patterns scored on a scale of 0-3. The score of 0 is given if the individual experiences pain during the movement and a 3 if there are no compensatory adjustments needed to perform the movement. Depending upon the severity of the compensatory adjustment, the individual being assessed with be assigned a score of 1-2.\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/unnamed%20(1).png)\\n\\nPinnacle Training Systems uses the FMS as a first step in helping the law enforcement personnel identify areas of weakness, asymmetry in movement patterns and overall risk of injury.

The FMS will also screen for pain indicators identifying individuals who should be referred for a diagnosis.

Not only do these changes in your demeanor have the potential to impact your work performance, but they can also negatively impact your personal relationships. By recognizing how the deterioration process takes place, law enforcement personnel will identify specific preventative strategies to reduce the negative emotional impact of our profession, regardless of if you are in the field or behind the headset. The book provides insight to encourage officers and dispatchers to remain committed, engaged and productive both at work and at home.\\n\\nGilmartin, Kevin M. is the author of Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement: A Guide for Officer and Their Families - Kevin M.

A Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) program is an innovative, community-based approach to improve the outcomes of these encounters.\\n\\nIn over 2,700 communities nationwide, CIT programs create connections between law enforcement, mental health providers, hospital emergency services and individuals with mental illness and their families. Through collaborative community partnerships and intensive training, CIT improves communication, identifies mental health resources for those in crisis and ensures officer and community safety.\\n\\nThe Benefits of CIT\\n\\nNot only can CIT programs bring community leaders together, they can also help keep people with mental illness out of jail and in treatment, on the road to recovery. That's because diversion programs like CIT reduce arrests of people with mental illness while simultaneously increasing the likelihood that individuals will receive mental health services. CIT programs also:\\n\\nGive police officers more tools to do their job safely and effectively. Research shows that CIT is associated with improved officer attitude and knowledge about mental illness. In Memphis, for example, CIT resulted in an 80% reduction of officer injuries during mental health crisis calls.\\n\\nKeep law enforcement's focus on crime. Some communities have found that CIT has reduced the time officers spend responding to a mental health call. This puts officers back into the community more quickly.\\n\\nProduce cost savings. It's difficult to estimate exactly how much diversion programs can save communities. But incarceration is costly compared to community-based treatment. For example in Detroit an inmate with mental illness in jail costs $31,000 a year, while community-based mental health treatment costs only $10,000 a year.\\n\\nBest Practice Guide\\n\\nCIT International published \\"Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Programs: A Best Practice Guide for Transforming Community Responses to Mental Health Crises,\\" which is the first comprehensive guide for communities to best practices for starting and sustaining CIT programs. The guide takes a practical approach, providing examples and templates to inspire CIT programs, and worksheets to help facilitate difficult conversations among partners. Each chapter includes a case study from a CIT program, highlighting how communities are implementing CIT in different contexts. For example, Chapter 2: Make a Commitment, describes how rural Malheur County, Oregon, built a strong CIT steering committee, and Chapter 6: Sustain and Grow Your CIT Program, features Ohio's statewide CIT network.\\n\\nThe guide includes six chapters, along with resources and examples, that guide local mental health advocates, mental health professionals, law enforcement and community leaders through the process of starting and sustaining their CIT programs: \\n\\nChapter 1: Learn about Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Programs and Find Allies\\n\\nChapter 2: Make a Commitment \\n\\nChapter 3: Understand Your Crisis Response System \\n\\nChapter 4: Build the Infrastructure for Success \\n\\nChapter 5: Plan and Deliver Officer Training \\n\\nChapter 6: Sustain and Grow Your CIT Program \\n\\nThe full guide can be downloaded [here](http://www.citinternational.org/resources/Best%20Practice%20Guide/CIT%20guide%20interactive%20web%20version%20final.pdf). \\n\\nSources\\n\\n[![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/button_crisis-intervention-team%20(1).png)](https://www.nami.org/Advocacy/Crisis-Intervention/Crisis-Intervention-Team-(CIT)-Programs)\\n\\n[![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/namibutton.png)](https://www.nami.org/home)", "title": "Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)", "summary": "In over 2,700 communities nationwide, Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) programs create connections between law enforcement, mental health providers, hospital emergency services and individuals with mental illness and their families.

Not only do these changes in your demeanor have the potential to impact your work performance, but they can also negatively impact your personal relationships. By recognizing how the deterioration process takes place, law enforcement personnel will identify specific preventative strategies to reduce the negative emotional impact of our profession, regardless of if you are in the field or behind the headset.

These include avoidance behaviors, such as calling in sick at work, backing out of social activities or family events, and not talking about the event with others. Other changes include increased use of alcohol or other substances, either for their calming effects, to get to sleep, or to distract away from distressing thoughts about the event. This can quickly develop into a serious problem. If you find yourself, or a colleague, using alcohol much more after a critical incident, right now is the time to take steps to be back in charge of alcohol use, and to find more effective ways of coping.\\n\\nSelf-blame is also common after critical incidents, based on the belief that something could have been done differently to prevent or lessen the critical incident. It involves the belief that if only you had done this instead of that, or if only you had reacted more quickly, you could have stopped the terrible event. Although it is very common to think of things you might have done differently in a situation, it is useful to remember that most situations involve many different factors, and it may be impossible to know with certainty the best thing to do in a dangerous, unpredictable situation.\\n\\nWatch also for recurring thoughts such as doubts about your abilities, your courage, or your resilience. Although nearly everyone feels fear and has strong physical reactions when in danger, those who are less affected by critical incidents are those who accept these responses as normal, and do not judge themselves for having these responses. If you find yourself thinking, “I cracked under pressure,” because you felt fear and your heart raced and you hesitated in a crisis situation, it is worth examining these ideas more closely. Negative self-talk can become a distraction. If you find yourself having recurrent negative thoughts, consider contacting your agency’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or scheduling an appointment with a behavioral health provider to get a clearer picture of these thoughts, and how you might be able to modify your thinking to keep you at your best.", "title": "Looking for Symptoms of Critical Incident Stress", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-20 19:52:44.854171+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 19:52:44.854171+00	\N	f

We offer detoxification, residential inpatient, and intensive outpatient treatment for alcohol, post traumatic stress, addiction, trauma, anxiety and depression. Our team of highly trained and culturally competent clinicians will help you heal. \\n\\nTreatment Exclusively for First Responders \\n\\nWhat we know conclusively from multiple research studies about post traumatic stress is that it physically changes the brain. Our first responders are having a very human reaction to their environment. This is normal considering their day to day activities with the never ending threat assessments, human tragedy, and dangerous situations they encounter. Many first responders turn to alcohol or substances as a means of coping. When alcohol or substances are used for self-medication purposes, the person is more likely to become dependent upon that substance than an individual who is a social drinker or recreational user. Due to acute stress and trauma, it’s common for first responders to develop [co-occurring](https://www.addictioncenter.com/alcohol/alcohol-dual-diagnosis/) mental health and substance use issues. In fact, up to 50% of those with mental health diagnoses are also affected by addiction. Our unique program will treat both mental health and substance abuse or misuse.\\n\\nWhere \\n\\nFirst Responder Wellness is located in the coastal community of Orange County, CA. Our residential inpatient homes are comfortable, well maintained, and about two miles from the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nCall us today for a confidential assessment [(888) 732-5731](tel:8887325731)", "title": "Simple Recovery", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-01 15:20:59.849729+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-01 15:23:52.937226+00	\N	f

It is strongly recommended that you seek out the services of a licensed financial professional before making investments or financial decisions.\\n\\nFinancial Fitness is an extremely important part of overall personal wellness. When an officer is worried about debts, unpaid bills, or a lack of savings to cover an emergency expense, he or she will be stressed, distracted, and less effective. This can compromise safety on the job. In addition, being stressed about finances can contribute to health problems through increased blood pressure, reduced immune system functioning, and more frequent illnesses. You may have financial matters mentally compartmentalized separately from work life, and may not think of budgeting and savings as relevant to work performance. However, financial fitness should take its place alongside other important practices such as staying physically fit, and completing practice at the shooting range. Law enforcement supervisors often find that their officers have become distressed, distracted, and less effective because of maxed out credit cards, excessive debt, or inadequate savings to pay for unexpected expenses. When their officers are stressed and preoccupied with money troubles, they are less effective, more prone to making errors, and even more likely to experience medical problems.\\n\\nInvesting a modest amount of time can help you on your way to financial fitness. Think of this as similar to putting in time at the gym. Putting in some time and effort exercising keeps the body fit and capable. If you put in the time to learn the basics of budgeting, savings, and investing, and then to put these into practice and you will be well on your way to becoming financially fit. Doing so will help ensure that you avoid recurrent financial stressors, so that you can stay focused and effective on the job.", "title": "Introduction", "videoUrl": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/452401131", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 13:43:32.494808+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:47:39.887937+00	\N	f

See the prior sections on Financial Fitness for the importance of investing early and getting a higher rate of return. However, around 3-4 years before the start of college, 50% to 75% of the investments should be shifted away from stocks to more stable assets such as Treasury Bills and cash, so that a drop in the stock market will not significantly affect how much you have available for college.\\n\\nSet up adequate insurance. Be sure that you have enough life insurance, as well as coverage for short-term disability, long-term disability, household goods, and flood. This way, even if disaster strikes, you will have the financial resources to prevent misfortune from becoming a financial catastrophe.\\n\\nBe good to your family; have a will made that specifies exactly what you want to be done with your belongings. Make a list of all of your important documents, investment account numbers, debts, and properties. Doing so will prevent your family from having to search these out, or worse, not gaining possession of assets they did not know about.", "title": "Other Tips", "summary": "If you have children plan to help them pay for college, open a tax-advantaged 529 College Savings account as soon as they are born (or as soon as you can), and contribute to it regularly, even if the amounts are small.

Chances are you've been far more impressed when you've observed someone put in work and achieve big growth. Some goals may be far in the distance, but just like the people we admire, it pays to identify the smaller steps or skills on the runway to success. Set each of these steps as a short-term goal, and track your progress. If your goal is to become a captain one day, find out what will be required for this position. Identify the short-term goals that you can complete immediately, and track your progress in these areas. Set a general timeline for when you would like to complete the longer-term requirements, including any special training, experiences, or coursework that would be required. Schedule in your calendar every 2-3 months a regular check-in to monitor your current progress and compare it with your long-term objectives. This will help keep you on track for a goal that may be years in achieving. By focusing primarily on completing the short-term goals that are steps along the way, you can track your progress and maintain your motivation, giving yourself credit each time you accomplish one of the short-term goals along the way.", "title": "Goal Five: Turn a Large, Long-Term Goal into Manageable Chunks", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-23 18:23:00.06049+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 20:50:36.101249+00	\N	f

His research also revealed that when men are unwilling to allow their partner influence in the relationship, there is an 81% likelihood that the relationship will fail. These findings indicate that sharing influence in relationships is important. However, this can be difficult for some.\\n\\nIf you find that you are generally reluctant to attempts by your partner to influence you, either through requests they make for changes in the home, social activities, or your own behaviors, you would likely benefit from becoming deliberately more open to being influenced. Here are some suggestions for doing so:\\n\\nIf you disagree with your spouse about a decision, seek common ground rather than trying to win the debate.\\n\\nIf you are having a disagreement, observe your behavior for signs of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling. If you notice them in yourself or your partner, pause the discussion and identify the problem behavior out loud. Remind yourself of the importance of working towards sharing influence, and resume the discussion with this goal in mind.\\n\\nIf you find yourself in a difficult disagreement with your partner, take a break from the discussion for a moment, to consider how you are speaking. Are using your words to \\"score points,\\" prove your partner wrong, or otherwise make sure that things are done your way? Or do you use words in a way that demonstrates honor and respect toward your partner, even if you disagree? As Dr. Gottman's research has shown, prioritizing getting your own way over respecting your partner is harmful to the relationship. Making a choice to putting your relationship above winning arguments will go a long way towards nurturing a stable and closer relationship.", "title": "Principle 4: Let Your Partner Influence You", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:28:57.435311+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:11:23.59365+00	\N	f

Everything is new, actions and reactions bring joy, and learning how to master something provides immense pride. You too started your life this way! Before moving on to the goal-setting and achievement strategies, think back to how you responded to various performance challenges in school, sports, or relationships. If you tried a sport but were not as good as others on the team at first, did you quit the team or did you put in extra time trying to improve your skills? If you got a bad grade, did you resign yourself to being no good at that subject or study harder? Did you expect that you were going to meet the \\"perfect person\\" or did you believe we're all a work in progress? Take a moment and remember something from your early life that you decided was worth learning, and that you were motivated to stick with to become significantly better? Do you remember the pride you felt after demonstrating your effort was paying off? Next, think about something you gave up on because you weren't a natural. Can you consider how you might have become good at a school subject, sport, or other skill if you had taken the time to learn the basics, stretched to master the next steps without judging yourself negatively until you were proficient?\\n\\nIf it looks like you have had a \\"fixed mindset\\" more of the time, believing that you either were good at something or you weren't, and trying to avoid challenges that would reveal that you weren't good at something, take a moment to see if you can shift your thinking. For the most part, that is how everyone becomes highly skilled; they learn a little bit at a time, and then progress from there. When you learned to ride a bike, you probably needed some skill development and some of the errors you made might have been painful. What was it that made you stick with it? Tap into that child who didn't have immediate expectations of success, accepted guidance, and viewed a lack of success as a positive challenge.\\n\\nA growth mindset promotes the steady, prolonged practice, and considers making mistakes to be as natural a part of improvement as breathing air. If you notice a sense of anxiety about looking foolish or struggling at first with a new skill, see if you can shift your perspective, where your job in learning the new ability is to get all of the mistakes out of the way as you master the skill.

The correctional officer job encourages a one-income household.\\n\\n**Unpredictable Hours:** Working as a correctional officer spouse is a huge challenge because a correctional officer’s schedule is so unpredictable. Yeah, sure, their shift says that they get off at a certain time but we learn very quickly what that really means. As a correctional officer spouse you might hear “I’ll be late, I’m not sure when I'm coming home.” Maybe there’s been a critical incident and you get “I’m not sure when they will even let us leave.” \\n\\n**Responsibilities with children:** I make the joke that prior to children my first response to an extended shift call out was “Do you have snacks? Call me as soon as you can!” With a child now, my response is closer to... a pause and a long “Okaaaaay”... and my thoughts are racing thinking now everything he was responsible for is my problem. What’s running through my head is that I have 2 hours before work to figure out what I need to cancel, rearrange, and/or get someone else to cover. Sometimes extended family can fill in these gaps, which we are very grateful to be able to utilize. \\n\\n**Good Income:** Not to mention that overtime is often times mandatory or easily accessible to make up for unexpected expenses. Like so many other correctional officer families you think it’s just easier if I stay home and you just work O.T. to fill in the gaps.” You share this decision with so many other families in a similar situation.\\n\\nHaving the option to stay home with your children is awesome! Making this decision out of pure excitement is one thing. Making it “because it just makes sense” is another. If you have your own passions and visions of a job or a hobby, maybe a specific degree in something you enjoy, or have the thing you keep putting off for “one day”... listen up. I’m going to ask you to rethink the decision for the following reasons.\\n\\nNot as helpful as we think: In these scenarios I think staying home full time and putting your dreams on hold has the potential to actually take away from your family (hear me out). What I mean is that we’re happier people when we feel fulfilled. Not that staying home with our children isn’t fulfilling, but if you personally have a dream of a life balanced out with something else, then finding that will absolutely benefit your children and your marriage.\\n\\nYour happiness is worth more: Please, don’t get stuck on, “I make as much as daycare would cost so it wouldn’t even be worth it.” Of course, it would be worth it! Even if you make exactly what daycare costs! I’m not looking at just numbers here. That’s silly because we’re human beings with real emotions and stress. Having something that feeds us emotionally is worth more than a number.\\n\\nHow it may positively impact the rest of your life: We’re happier! This means we combat stress and depression and we’re likely to have stronger relationships. We model positive coping skills for our children and have more tolerance for the stress parenting brings on. We feel less resentful in our marriage and toward the job correctional officers love so much and spend so much time at. This all has an extremely positive domino effect on our lives. So, don’t wait!\\n\\nWhat I am suggesting is that if there is a job or a hobby you desire please go out and find it! The same applies even if it’s not a passion exactly but you’re feeling like you could just use a little more balance in your life. Guilt free! Because ultimately, it’s going to benefit your family and your own wellness.\\n\\nAdapted from Dr. Rachelle Zemlok's article.

However, the fact that these studies have been replicated in different formats, and that plausible explanations for how this intervention works have been supported, suggests that this intervention would likely be helpful.\\n\\n**The following common features were reported in published studies for reducing intrusive memories:** \\n\\n1.  Re-activating the disturbing memory through some form of reminder. This can involve looking again at an image from a disturbing video, or simply calling up the image from your own memory. \\n2.  Engaging in Tetris or a similar visually intensive video game, for 10 to 20 minutes.\\n\\nRelated studies have shown that re-activating the disturbing memory is a necessary part of this technique, as this appears to be necessary to modify the storage of the memory. In other words, simply playing Tetris without first re-activating the memory would not likely be helpful.

If anything, calls increase! We have made it to the start of the holiday season: Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. What's your first responder spouse going to be missing? It's extremely unlikely they will be making them all. It's one of the things that makes our first responder family life so unique. Last year my husband missed our son's first year of trick or treating, but this year he has it off. He's home for Thanksgiving but working Christmas and New Year's. I seriously can't remember a New Year's we have shared together in the last five years.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the schedule doesn't care about what is important to your family. And the schedule can't let your first responder off early to make the tail end of your family's celebration. The family is left adjusting to the schedule. Part of being resilient is being ready to adjust when we cannot control, and there's a lot we cannot control especially when it comes to this season. Here are **five tips** on how to help your family adjust to the holiday schedule.\\n\\n1.  **Model Flexibility for Your Children**  \\n    We know that being flexible and having the ability to adapt to unexpected challenges can correlate to future success. I'd like you to know that our children learn that from us! Even if you feel really disappointed in the fact that your spouse is missing Christmas this year, please hold back from expressing all those emotions in front of your children. I don't want you to ignore your feelings, please discuss them with your spouse behind closed doors and come up with a plan. However, in front of your children model some problem-solving. Talk through the scheduling conflict you're having due to the traditions you have and ask for their input even! Help them get excited about the change and special differences in their family. _**They look to us to try and figure out if we can handle this type of challenge or not. Please model for them that we can!**_\\n2.  **Adjust Your Idea as to What \\"Holiday\\" Means**  \\n    We have three emergency responders in my immediate family and three in my husband's immediate family. All of their schedules are staggered! You can imagine how flexible we all have to be if we want to get everyone together. _**The calendar no longer dictates our holiday, it happens on the day and time we can all be together.**_ Fortunately, emergency responder schedules are very clear-cut. This means we can foresee whether our spouse will be working that day months in advance and can start discussing how it will be managed early enough. It's rare for my family that we all get together on the actual date the holiday lands on. Very often we will celebrate Christmas on the 23rd or another date that works for our schedules. However, there are rare occasions when we can all get together on the actual holiday, and this is an extra special time for us all.\\n3.  **Make First Responder Friendly Traditions**  \\n    You can still attend those traditions your extended family members hold, with or without your first responder spouse. On top of those, your immediate family should make new traditions that complement your family's lifestyle. You were likely able to hold those strong traditions you grew up with because you didn't grow up in a first responder family. Your children have a different reality. They likely have many years of adjustment ahead. My recommendation would be to make new traditions within your immediate family that are more first responder friendly. **_This means they don't depend on a date and time, but on an experience._** So that Christmas Eve gift opening might mean the last day your family has all together before Christmas. Maybe that's the 23rd because the first responder parent works the 24th and 25th. Sure your children will have a special gift a day early but what child wouldn't want that! Sometimes you may also have to get creative with how to make this work. Such as writing a couple of letters to Santa explaining the situation and asking for a gift delivery to the station so Dad can be there for it or to deliver gifts a day early due to your family's circumstances. I've heard Santa can be very flexible for first responder families.\\n4.  **Include the First Responder Spouse Any Way You Can**  \\n    There are also going to be holidays when we all just have to accept that our spouse will not be there, despite our best efforts. This happens when there are things you cannot reschedule (like trick or treating), my husband gets called into work last minute, or we just cannot arrange the holiday at another time. On these days we usually call or **_set up a video call so he can see the family and catch up at least for a moment._** This allows everyone to say hi and allows him to feel that he at least made an appearance. I see it as my role to \\"represent\\" for us. I always show up and carry on as usual.\\n5.  **Communicate and Plan Ahead**  \\n    Communication about your expectations and your spouse's expectations are key. **_Talk about it early, before the extended family starts making plans._** Just know that it's part of any first responder job and one of the more difficult aspects to get used to. With the right mindset, I promise, it is manageable. If you need more support around this I can help.

And while an officer's individual health and wellness are critical, the lifestyle and culture of law enforcement affect more than just the officer. Spouses, partners, parents, children, and companions of law enforcement play an essential role in their officer's health and wellness, serving as an essential support system for their loved ones. These families and friends also need support to respond to the unique challenges they and their officers face on and off the job. When officers feel that their family needs are met and respected, their safety wellness, and ability to do their job improves, leading to healthier and safer officers and communities.\\n\\nThe International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) is committed to supporting law enforcement family wellness. This guide contains information on healthy sleep habits, financial literacy, injury reduction, nutrition, helping your child understand your job, and suicide prevention. \\n\\nWe encourage agencies to customize the Local Resources page of this guide by adding information for Employee Assistance Programs, peer support programs, fitness resources, agency chaplains, crisis and support hotlines, and other services that are available to law enforcement families.

Be sure to tailor your conversation to your child’s developmental understanding. \\n\\n**What is your Job?**\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/help_child_temp3.jpg)\\n\\n**_When explaining your job, be sure to use age-appropriate language._** \\n\\nProvide examples of how you do your best to keep the community safe and what a typical day looks like. Discuss how you help people, protect people, and stop people from hurting others. Help your child find examples in their own life of how s/he helps others.\\n\\n**Why are you always gone?**\\n\\n**_Your child may notice that your schedule means missing some events._**\\n\\nBe honest with your child about why and when you will have to miss things. Try some of these strategies:\\n\\nDon’t make promises you can’t keep. Sometimes things do come up unexpectedly, so be mindful of what you are committing to, as to not overpromise or disappoint your child.\\n\\nFind a special activity or event to enhance special parent/child bonding time. This will help your child feel more connected to you when you can’t be there.\\n\\nExplain why the work you are doing is so important. Giving a purpose to the absence may bring your child some comfort.\\n\\n**Is your job dangerous?**\\n\\n**_Explain the safety precautions you take to stay safe._**\\n\\nWearing your seatbelt, wearing your protective vest, and using your training. Clarify there is no way to guarantee your safety, but you have all the tools you need to keep you safe. \\n\\n**_Show your child your vest and duty belt_.** \\n\\nExplain to your child that you are part of a team and that your team is crucial to your safety.

Find healthy outlets for stress and anxiety. Exercising, journaling, or openly discussing your emotions are all ways to cope with stress and anxiety. \\n\\nIf anxiety results in your child’s refusal to go to school, fear of the outside world, or difficulty focusing, schedule an appointment with your child’s doctor.\\n\\n**Firearm Safety**\\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/help_child_temp_42.jpg)\\n\\n**_Teach your child what to do if they ever come across a firearm_**\\n\\nHelp remove the mystery around your service weapons. Teaching basic gun safety removes some of the curiosity children may have.\\n\\n***_Safe storage is the number one way to prevent firearm accidents._*** \\n\\nWeapons should be stored out of reach, in a safe with a lock, and unloaded. Consider adding a trigger lock and a specific gun lock box for storage when your firearm is not on your person. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/help_child_temp_31.jpg)", "title": "IACP: Helping Your Young Child Understand Your Job", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-13 20:37:51.603675+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-19 22:45:06.86802+00	\N	f

When an officer or correctional staff is worried about debts, unpaid bills, or a lack of savings to cover an emergency expense, they will be stressed, distracted, and less effective. This can compromise safety on the job. In addition, being stressed about finances can contribute to health problems through increased blood pressure, reduced immune system functioning, and more frequent illnesses. You may have financial matters mentally compartmentalized separately from work life, and may not think of budgeting and savings as relevant to work performance. However, financial fitness should take its place alongside other important practices such as staying physically fit. Management often find that their officers or staff have become distressed, distracted, and less effective because of maxed out credit cards, excessive debt, or inadequate savings to pay for unexpected expenses. When their officers or staff are stressed and preoccupied with money troubles, they are less effective, more prone to making errors, and are even more likely to experience medical problems.\\n\\nInvesting a modest amount of time can help you on your way to financial fitness.

They both earned the same salaries. But their financial situations followed very different paths. After working in lower-wage jobs before entering corrections, Alex was excited to start making a larger salary. Alex took advantage of the credit card offers, bought a nice car (with no money down!), and soon put a down payment on a house with a mortgage that was at the very limit of what they qualified for.\\n\\nWithin the first year, Alex’s credit cards were near their maximum limits. Alex couldn’t pay them down, because their car payments and mortgage took most of their salary. So, Alex paid 14% interest on the balance carried on the credit cards. Alex couldn’t draw from their savings to pay the credit cards down, because there was no savings – all of Alex’s salary went towards making payments on their acquired debt. As the years went by, Alex significantly cut back on spending – by necessity, since the credit cards were maxed out. Eventually, the car broke down, and the air conditioner in the house needed to be replaced. Financial pressures became a steady source of stress. Alex realized that by carrying a total balance of $10,000 on the credit cards, and paying only the minimum required amount, they was paying more than $1,400 per year in interest charges alone. At this rate, even though Alex paid $200 or more each month, Alex still owed nearly $9,000 at the end of the year. Alex realized that if they continued living this way, it would take more than six years to pay off his credit cards, even if no additional purchases were made with the credit cards. And Alex would end up paying more than $5,000 in interest – exactly half of what was spent on the credit cards in the first place. With no savings, maxed out credit cards, and no money left over after paying the bills, Alex realized that significant changes needed to be made.\\n\\nOfficer Taylor was having much better financial success. Taylor carried no credit card balance. Instead, Taylor kept track of how much income was available each month, the amount of money they had in savings, and saved up for large purchases. Taylor made sure to build up enough money in their savings account so that if an unexpected expense arose, they would be able to cover it. Taylor saved up for a down payment on a home that was well within their means, so that they could pay the mortgage note without fear of running out of money each month. Although Taylor received many credit card offers and could have filled their house with expensive new furniture and a large home theater system, they only purchased furnishings that they could afford without draining their savings too much. Taylor bought a few more items each month as their income permitted, staying within their monthly budget each time. Because Taylor planned well and spent less than they made, every month they was able to add to their investment account, which was growing increasingly larger. Down the road this investment account would give Taylor the freedom to pay for things that they valued, like taking trips, buying a nicer car, putting their children through college, or retiring early.\\n\\nHow did Officer Taylor end up so much better off than Officer Alex? Taylor followed three simple but powerful guidelines to make sure that they were financially fit.

d5ea39cd-098b-457b-b765-4bcff4278541	Corr - Heart Health for Correctional Officers - Risk Factors	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## **Risk Factors**\\n\\n\\n**Overview**\\n\\nIn addition to genetic factors for heart conditions, several important factors have been identified that increase the likelihood that someone will develop a heart condition. These include high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, high blood sugar (glucose), physical inactivity (lack of exercise), unhealthy diet, obesity, and smoking. In addition to these general factors, working in a correctional setting may involve sudden transitions from light activity to periods of very high stress and high physical demand, placing high demands on the heart. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that the risk of sudden cardiac death increased dramatically for police officers during sudden high-stress activities. The risk of sudden cardiac death was 30 to 60 times higher during altercations or restraining suspects, and 30 to 50 times higher during pursuits. Although the study involved police officers, these findings would apply to Correctional Officers because of the similarly stressful nature of altercations and situations involving restraining inmates. The combination of these risk factors has resulted in Correctional Officers having an especially high rate of cardiovascular-related deaths, including heart conditions other than sudden cardiac death. With these sobering statistics in mind, we review below the risk factors for heart disease. \\n\\n**Risk Factor: High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**\\n\\nHypertension can cause significant harm to health over time. The American Heart Association classifies blood pressure as normal if it is below 120/80. Here, the 120 is the systolic reading (when the heart forces blood through the arteries), and 80 is the diastolic reading (when the heart is at rest). Stage 1 Hypertension reflects blood pressure readings from 130/80 to 139/89, and Stage 2 Hypertension as blood pressure readings 140/90 or higher. Stage 1 and Stage 2 Hypertension are present if either the systolic or diastolic number is in the range described. For example, a blood pressure reading of 135/70 would be considered Stage 1 Hypertension because the Systolic reading is 135, even though the diastolic number (70) is normal. For most people, there are no symptoms of high blood pressure that you would be able to observe. In other words, you could feel normal and still have high blood pressure, and so the only way to be sure about your blood pressure is to check it with a blood pressure instrument. If hypertension remains untreated, it can lead to heart attack, stroke, sexual dysfunction, kidney failure, and loss of vision. These serious health consequences occur because the persistently high blood pressure causes damage to the blood vessels that supply the heart, brain, retina and other parts of the eye, kidneys, sex organs, and all other tissues of the body. Untreated hypertension tends to cause gradual damage to these blood vessels, resulting in the death of tissues such as the retina, heart muscle, kidneys, and so on. One of the most serious consequences of untreated hypertension is a heart attack, in which the damaged arteries around the heart become blocked, preventing adequate blood from supplying the heart muscle. When this occurs, life-threatening damage may occur to the heart muscle, and in fact, many victims of heart attack do not survive. Hypertension also significantly increases the risk for a stroke, in which blood flow to parts of the brain is decreased or blocked entirely. Effects of stroke can range from relatively mild symptoms, to devastating injuries including paralysis, inability to speak or understand language, blindness, or death. \\n\\n**Risk Factor: High Cholesterol** \\n\\nThere are at least two types of cholesterol: **Low-density lipoprotein** (LDL) cholesterol is considered to be “bad”, and **high-density lipoprotein (HDL)** cholesterol is considered to be “good”. High levels of “bad” (LDL) cholesterol promotes the buildup of plaques on the lining of the walls of the arteries, which can eventually block the flow of blood. This can cause a heart attack if blood to the heart is blocked, or a stroke if blood to the brain is blocked. High levels of LDL cholesterol are strongly associated with heart disease. Eating foods high in saturated fat (found in fatty meat, cheese, and tropical oils such as palm oil and coconut oil) promotes higher levels of LDL cholesterol and so increases the risk of heart disease. On the other hand, higher levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol appears to be protective against heart disease because it removes circulating LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Current CDC [guidelines for interpreting cholesterol](https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/cholesterol_screening.htm) scores list desirable (healthy) values as LDL (“bad”) cholesterol at less than 100 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter); HDL (“good”) cholesterol at 60 mg/dl or higher, triglycerides less than 150 mg/dl, and total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl. If you don’t know your cholesterol numbers or have not had your cholesterol tested in recent years, it would be well worth your while to schedule testing with your doctor. If your cholesterol is outside of the healthy ranges described above, talk with your doctor about ways to improve your cholesterol numbers. Steps for modifying your cholesterol are also described later in this module. \\n\\n**Risk Factor: High Blood Sugar (Glucose)** \\n\\nHigh levels of blood sugar (also referred to as glucose) may be a sign of diabetes, although elevated blood sugar can be present in people without a diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetes involves a deficiency in the body’s ability to produce the right amount of insulin. When working properly, the pancreas releases insulin when blood sugar increases, such as after a meal. Insulin travels through the bloodstream and causes cells throughout the body to open their barriers to allow glucose into the cell, either to be converted for use as energy, or to be converted into storage for later use. In diabetes, not enough insulin is produced or released, and so higher levels of glucose continue to circulate in the bloodstream. The circulating glucose is harmful to cells throughout the body, including the heart. In fact, heart disease is the most frequent cause of death among those with diabetes. When blood sugar levels frequently become elevated, blood vessels supplying the heart become damaged. In addition, the nerve supply for both the heart and blood vessels become damaged by elevated blood sugar, making it more difficult for the heart to work effectively. Over time, this can lead to heart disease, disability, and possibly premature death. \\n\\n**Risk Factor: Physical Inactivity** \\n\\nFor most of the time humans have been alive, their daily activities including significant physical movement, from hunter-gatherer cultures to pre-industrial farming. Our bodies, including our cardiovascular system, adapted over the centuries for regular physical activity. However, many current jobs involve mostly sitting—at a desk, or behind the wheel of a vehicle. As a result, many people would rarely get any exercise unless they explicitly planned to do so. However, many people do not recognize the importance of regular exercise, or do not set and follow scheduled times for exercise. This has resulted in a massive increase in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other “diseases of modern life”. Physical inactivity includes prolonged lying, sitting, or standing, either as part of work or free time. This can include seated desk work, driving a vehicle, or standing without significant walking. Free time sedentary activities include watching television, playing video games, being on a smartphone, and other activities that require little physical movement or energy output. Physical inactivity is strongly associated with many negative health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. And there is reason to believe that physical inactivity itself negatively affects health, even for people who get some exercise. Some studies have found that among samples of people who get at least the recommended minimum amount of weekly exercise (150 minutes of cardiovascular activity), those who spent more hours sitting each day were still at increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke. These results suggest that moving regularly throughout the day, rather than sitting, has heart health benefits above and beyond those of regular planned exercise. It is important to recognize that, unless your job duties involve regular physical activity, it will be up to you to ensure that you are getting adequate regular physical movement throughout the day, and adequate cardiovascular exercise of at least 150 minutes each week. More information on exercise is provided later in this module. \\n\\n**Risk Factor: Unhealthy Diet** \\n\\nFood that is readily available, convenient, affordable, and tasty, is unfortunately, often the worst kind of food for your health. This includes most snacks in vending machines or in convenience stores, and most fast foods. However, what you eat on a daily basis has an important impact on your heart health. A large study of causes of death in more than 700,000 people found that nearly half of the deaths were associated with unhealthy eating patterns. Heart disease deaths were especially strongly associated with high intake of salt, processed meats, and sugary beverages, and with lower intake of nuts. Death from stroke was associated with excessive salt, and low amounts of fruits and vegetables.  One of the main problems with processed, packaged, and restaurant foods is that they often contain excess sodium, partly in the form of table salt (which has the chemical formula NaCl, or sodium chloride). However, sodium can be present from other sources such as bread, pizza, soups, and ingredients that do not necessarily taste salty, such as baking soda. While the recommended intake of sodium is 2400 milligrams per day, Americans consume on average 3400 milligrams per day. High sodium intake contributes to high blood pressure, which directly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. While the factors that contribute to heart health are complicated, it is clear that eating too much of unhealthy foods and too little of healthier choices, such as fruits and vegetables, interferes with your body’s ability to maintain optimal heart health. Recommendations for healthy food choices are described later in the module.   \\n\\n**Risk Factor: Obesity** \\n\\nFood habits that involve consuming larger amounts, eating more frequently, and consuming food and drink that are higher in calories will promote overweight and obesity, which is an additional risk factor for heart disease. Excessive intake of high-calorie food and drinks, such as soft drinks, donuts, cookies, and other sugar-laden items is especially problematic. Many adults find that their metabolism begins to slow with age, so that they burn fewer calories per day than when they were younger. There is also a tendency to simply move less as we get older, which makes us burn still fewer calories. At the same time, our eating habits may tend to stay the same, as we look forward to the same favorite foods, in the same amount, as earlier in life. However, without increasing physical activity to offset the amount of calories being consumed, we will naturally store excess calories as fat. If this continues, we become overweight, and then obese. \\n\\nBody Mass Index and Obesity The CDC provides a calculator to estimate Body Mass Index (BMI), which you can access here ([CDC BMI calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html)). BMI is based on your height and weight, and provides a general reference for indicating whether someone is overweight or obese. BMI is not a perfect indication of obesity; for example, weightlifters or others with a lot of muscle mass and little fat will have an inaccurately high BMI, because large muscles weigh more than fat. However, for most other people, BMI provides a good estimate of their BMI. The CDC classifies a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 as Normal, BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 as Overweight, and 30.0 and above as Obese. Having a BMI of 30 to 39 is associated with approximately 65 to 85% higher risk of heart disease compared with having a BMI between 18 and 24.9. A BMI of 40 or higher was associated with 2.5 to 3 times greater risk for cardiovascular disease, compared with normal BMI range. \\n\\n**Waist Circumference and Obesity** \\n\\nThe CDC and American Heart Association have also used waist circumference as an indicator of obesity. Waist circumference is simply the distance around your body at the waist; people with more fat tissue tend to have a greater waist circumference. A waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men, or greater than 35 inches for non-pregnant women, was classified as increased risk for heart disease (coronary vascular disease) and other significant medical problems. To accurately measure your waist circumference, [the CDC provides the following guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/index.html): \\n\\n*   “Stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. \\n*   Make sure tape is horizontal around the waist\\n*   Keep the tape snug around the waist, but not compressing the skin\\n*   Measure your waist just after you breathe out” (CDC.gov)\\n\\nStaying in the healthy weight range has powerful positive effects in preventing heart disease, as well as many other medical conditions. Recommendations for reaching a healthy weight are provided later in the module. \\n\\n**Risk Factor: Smoking**\\n\\nWe have known for decades that smoking tobacco, including cigarettes, pipe, and cigars, contributes to many significant health problems including numerous cancers, emphysema, and heart disease. While smoking rates have decreased significantly in recent years, some continue to smoke. Tobacco smoke includes many chemicals, some of which cause inflammation of the cells linking blood vessels, which narrows the blood vessels and makes them less effective in transporting blood. Smoking also causes increased plaque formation inside the walls of blood vessels. This also reduces blood flow throughout the body. When the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle become significantly narrowed or blocked, this is called coronary heart disease. This can cause gradual deterioration of heart tissue and reduce its ability to pump blood throughout the body. If a blood clot or segment of plaque blocks blood flow to the heart, this may cause heart attack, which may be fatal. Because chemicals inhaled from tobacco cause blood to become thicker and to form clots, these blockages causing coronary heart disease and heart attack are significantly more common among smokers. The risk of heart conditions increases with smoking frequency; smoking two packs per day is significantly more damaging to the heart than smoking a half pack per day. However, smoking even small daily amounts of tobacco significantly increases the risk of heart conditions compared with not smoking at all.", "title": "Risk Factors", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 16:11:26.634973+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 16:11:26.634973+00	\N	f

Most people require 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. If you routinely get less than 7 hours per night there may be physical, psychological, or cognitive effects as a result of persistent sleep deprivation. It may be tempting to remain awake watching tv, staying on your smartphone, or otherwise “zoning out” when going off duty. However, irritability, fatigue, concentration problems, and other effects of sleep deprivation can interfere with effective work performance and may cause interpersonal problems as well. In keeping with the principle of active coping described earlier, a great step you can take toward avoiding burnout would be to make it a priority to get 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep as much as your shift allows. If you work night shifts and must sleep during the day, investing in blackout curtains, a white noise machine or fan, and earplugs can help you get the deeper levels of sleep that are critical for maintaining physical health, including brain functioning. If you prioritize getting into bed at a time that allows 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, you can help to guard against potential burnout.

Their dedication to their work causes them to \\"over-identify\\" with their role as a police officer, and to \\"under-identify\\" with all of their other previous roles (e.g., spouse, parent, friend, hunter, and athlete). The inertia they experience at the low level of the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster leads them to engage less and less frequently in any activities that are not related to police work. Because of their over-identification as police officers, they become vulnerable to anything that might affect their professional life. Many aspects of their on-duty behavior are controlled by others - those who set schedules, give out assignments, issue equipment, and decide promotions. When those in control do something with unpleasant consequences (e.g., forced overtime or being moved to overnight shifts), this is often experienced as \\"getting screwed.\\" Although such events happen to all police officers at times, some officers accept this as just the nature of the job, while others begin to view this as a never-ending series of injustices and begin to see themselves as victims. Some officers are unable to let go of this sense of injustice. They become distrustful of the agency, develop a sense of hostility toward the profession, and engage in ineffective coping (e.g., filing grievances or going on disability leave). \\n\\nHowever, while it is true that officers have very little control over their on-duty time, officers who develop a victim mentality allow this to extend to the idea that they also have no control over their off-duty personal time. In contrast, police officers who develop a survivor mentality, rather than a victim mentality, recognize that they can and must be in charge of their personal time as much as possible. Dr. Gilmartin's book describes in more detail the characteristics of a survivor orientation, which are summarized in the following section: Being a Survivor.", "title": "Which Officers are Most at Risk?", "summary": "It is often the most idealistic and committed officers who are at the greatest risk for developing cynicism and having deterioration in their personal lives.

The best strategies for utilizing the wellness tools for officers and staff include:\\n\\n*   Know your resources! Things might come up for you while using this app and if you feel that you are having a mental or medical emergency call 911 immediately. \\n*   Familiarize yourself with as many tools and resources as possible, then take the tools that work for you and leave the rest. Develop strong proficiency with a core set of wellness practices rather than attempting to master everything. \\n*   Practice foundation-level wellness behaviors (such as deep breathing or muscle relaxation) to strengthen your proficiency with these tools. This will help to promote your wellness on a daily basis, while also strengthening your resiliency. \\n*   Appreciate that different tools are appropriate to different needs and situations. For example, some correctional officers find they achieve their greatest stress-reduction benefits from mindfulness and meditation practices, whereas other prefer regular cardiovascular exercise. Every correctional officer is unique. \\n*   Consider sharing the tools that work for you so that other correctional officers or correctional staff may benefit, while appreciating that different people benefit from different approaches to wellness. Sharing what works for you can help to bolster the wellness of others. \\n*   Build upon your strengths.

2457def9-b9bd-456b-898e-a49cb6403c57	Corr - Heart Health for Correctional Officers - Becoming Heart Healthy	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "**Becoming Heart Healthy**\\n\\nThe American Heart Association and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have developed a number of recommendations for keeping your heart healthy and strong and functioning well. These recommendations are based on decades of research on the factors that play the most important role in determining whether or not someone will develop heart problems. These recommendations are summarized below. For additional resources, go to the [American Heart Association diet and lifestyle recommendations](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/aha-diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations), and [CDC resources to prevent heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/prevention.htm). \\n\\n**Recommendation: Manage Your Blood Pressure**    \\nThere are many ways to reduce blood pressure, and most people can benefit from trying several or all of these approaches. These include getting regular exercise, losing weight (if currently overweight), reducing sodium intake, practicing meditation and stress reduction. \\n\\n_**Exercise and Weight Loss.**_ \\n\\nGuidelines for exercise specify engaging in moderate-intensity activities that increase heart rate and breathing rate, between 3 and 6 times per week, for a target of at least 150 minutes total per week. This can include brisk walking, running, cycling, or organized fitness routines. However, even if you cannot meet this target, expert guidelines indicate that any amount of physical exercise provides some benefits in heart health. If you are not yet ready to plan scheduled exercise times, try to follow the simple principle of “move more, sit less”. By increasing the amount of time you are in motion, you will likely begin to lose weight as well, and the more time spent in motion, the greater the weight loss on average.  \\n\\n_**Reduce Sodium.**_ \\n\\nBecause sodium promotes water retention, which increases blood pressure, reducing sodium intake is important. This includes reducing the use of table salt on food, but also trying to select foods lower in sodium content, keeping in mind that sodium is not always in the form of table salt.  \\n\\n_**Meditate****.**_ \\n\\nThe Cordico Wellness app includes a Mindfulness module, including a section on mindfulness meditation. Regularly practicing meditation has been associated with reduced blood pressure. \\n\\n_**Reduce Stress.**_ \\n\\nAnother Cordico Wellness app module addresses Stress Management, with several different stress-reducing exercises and practices. Managing stress more effectively can also contribute to reduced blood pressure.  \\n\\n**_Blood Pressure Medications._** \\n\\nSeveral prescription medications are effective at reducing blood pressure. Consult with your physician about whether a blood pressure medication is right for your situation.\\n\\n**Recommendation: Control Cholesterol**\\n\\nThere is a significant genetic component that influences serum cholesterol levels, and some people continue to have high cholesterol levels even if they exercise, follow a recommended diet, and maintain a healthy weight. However, there are a number of steps that can be taken to lower your cholesterol. Because of the complexity of managing cholesterol, decisions about how to manage high cholesterol readings should be made in consultation with your physician. \\n\\n**_Replacing “Bad” Dietary Fats for “Healthy” Fats._** \\n\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has found consistent, strong evidence that total cholesterol and “bad” LDL cholesterol can be lowered by reducing consumption of saturated fats such as beef, pork, dairy, and tropical oils, and replacing them in your diet with polyunsaturated fats such as those in olive oil, walnuts, sunflower seeds, salmon. \\n\\n**_Exercise._** \\n\\nBoth cardiovascular exercise and strength training have been shown to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and raise HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It appears that engaging in high-intensity exercise, like High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) routines, may result in even better cholesterol profiles.\\n\\n**_Medication._** \\n\\nSeveral different medications are effective in lowering cholesterol, such as statins. Given the significant cardiac risk of untreated high cholesterol, it is important to make sure that your cholesterol levels are in a healthy range. If you have persistently high cholesterol, make it a priority to consult with your physician about whether cholesterol-lowering medication would be a good choice.\\n\\n**Recommendation: Manage Blood Sugar**\\n\\nIf you have diabetes or have been told by your physician that your blood sugar levels are high, be sure to follow your physician’s guidelines for managing your blood sugar levels. This may involve monitoring blood sugar during the day, following a customized eating schedule, taking medication, using insulin, or some combination of these measures. Keeping high blood sugar levels in check will help to keep your heart healthy and protected from harmful effects of excessive blood sugar.  \\n  \\n**Recommendation: Get Active  \\n**  \\nIt is by now universally acknowledged that cardiovascular exercise, which can include a large range of possibility activities, is one of the most important factors in maintaining heart health. Here are the principles for heart health from the CDC, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association:\\n\\n*   Get at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week. At moderate intensity your heart rate will increase, and you will breathe harder, but would still be able to talk. This can include brisk walking (at least 2.5 miles per hour), biking at 10 miles per hour, gardening, or dancing. There is also strong evidence that increasing time spent in moderate exercise to 300 minutes (5 hours) per week provides even greater health benefits.\\n*   Minimize the amount of time spent sitting, even if just to move around. Sitting is sedentary behavior, and the more time spent in sedentary behavior, the poorer the effects on heart health.\\n*   Engage in moderate- to high-intensity strength training twice per week. Keeping your muscle groups strong will help you to avoid injury and will help you to avoid weight gain. Strength training also results in greater muscle mass, which burns more calories at rest than the same amount of fat tissue. \\n*   Commit to making exercise a regular, long-term habit. While some people throw themselves into an ambitious and demanding exercise routine for a few weeks or months, they may find it difficult to stay motivated to continue if too much time is required or if the activity is not enjoyable. Rather than modify their exercise routine, they may simply stop altogether. It is far better to find an exercise activity that is enjoyable, so that you will look forward to it, rather than an activity that you begin to dread and avoid. And mixing up your routine for variety can help keep you engaged. This might include scheduling brisk walks or bicycling with a friend or family member a few days a week, gardening or yard work on another day, and an exercise class or cardiovascular activity at the gym one or two days a week. \\n\\nThe American Medical Association notes that 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity can be substituted for the 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. Vigorous intensity would include running, jumping rope, bicycling faster than 10 miles per hour, playing singles tennis, or doing strenuous yardwork such as continuous digging or hoeing. Recent research indicates that High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) can provide the same benefits as moderate exercise in significantly less time. High Intensity Interval Training involves running, cycling, or other aerobic exercises, with a pattern of alternating between short periods of moderate intensity (approximately 50% of maximum effort) and high intensity (85-90% of maximum effort). There appear to be some added health benefits that may be distinct to HIIT, such as enhanced metabolic functioning, so that incorporating at least some HIIT activities into your weekly schedule would likely be beneficial.  \\n\\nFor any exercise program, be sure that you are medically cleared to engage in the exercise routine. If it has been awhile since you have exercised, follow the principle of easing back into fitness, starting at a lower intensity for shorter periods of time, and then gradually working your way up in the intensity and duration of the exercise. Some people who have become out of shape seem to feel the need to punish themselves or otherwise suffer for their current state by overdoing it in the gym or on a run. They can easily end up injured, extremely sore, and demoralized, making them much less likely to return to work on their fitness goals the next day, and the day after, and so on. One of the most important features of physical activity for heart health is getting regular exercises consistently, week after week, year after year. Selecting a variety of different enjoyable exercise activities will help you to stick with regular exercise for the long haul.\\n\\n**Recommendation: Eat Well**\\n\\nEating better does not mean depriving yourself of enjoyable foods, but instead involves eating a variety of foods, with an emphasis on healthier choices from the different food groups. The American Heart Association’s general guidelines are to emphasize a variety of different fruits and vegetables, skinless poultry and fish, whole grains, low-fat dairy products such as milk and cheese, nuts and legumes (such as pinto beans, black beans, or kidney beans), and using olive oil or other non-tropical oils.\\n\\nWhile no single food should be considered off-limits forever, it is important to be mindful of the amount and kinds of food you are consuming. Check the nutrition labels on foods that you buy, and notice the number of calories, grams of sugar, and amount of sodium compared with daily recommended amounts. Daily average calories needed are estimated at 1600 to 2400 for women, and 2000 to 3000 calories for men, with the lower end for sedentary behaviors and the higher end for higher activity levels. When reading food labels, keep in mind that some items may be considered to be 2 or more servings, so that calories per serving may be misleading. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to no more than 1500 mg per day. It is important to check nutrition labels on food because much of our sodium intake is from ingredients other than salt; in fact, many high-sodium foods do not taste salty. So be sure to look at nutrition labels to keep track of how much sodium you are consuming currently, and then make modifications with a goal of getting your sodium below 1500 mg (milligrams) per day.\\n\\nGeneral healthy eating approaches can help to reduce sodium intake, as well as sugar and other less healthy ingredients. These include limiting sugary drinks, candy, processed meats (such as sausage or salami), and other highly processed foods; and avoiding tropical oils (such as coconut or palm oil), partially hydrogenated oils (such as margarine, packaged foods, and fried foods); and avoid excess calories. Consulting the nutrition label will help you identify foods with these ingredients and can help you to estimate how many calories you are currently consuming. If you are consuming more calories than you are using, these excess calories will be stored as fat. If your current weight is higher than you would like, gathering information about your current calorie intake is a helpful step in identifying ways to reduce calories and get to a healthy weight.\\n\\nOne eating plan called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) can help maintain heart health by keeping blood pressure in a healthy range. The DASH approach also emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and foods with adequate fiber and potassium, while minimizing foods with too much sodium, cholesterol, or saturated fats.\\n\\nAlthough the serving amounts will vary depending on how many calories you burn in the course of a day, the American Heart Association provides the following “Smart choices” guidelines for daily food intake:\\n\\n*   Vegetables: (fresh, frozen, canned, dried): 5 servings or 2.5 cups\\n*   Fruits (fresh, frozen, canned, and dried): 4 servings or 2 cups\\n*   Grains: (at least half should be whole grain): 6 servings or 6 ounces\\n*   Dairy (low-fat or fat-free). 3 servings or 3 cups  \\n    \\n*   Proteins (fish, skinless poultry, lean meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, beans and legumes \\\\[such as pinto beans, black beans, or kidney beans\\\\]) 2 servings or 5.5 oz.\\n*   Oils (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (3 tbsp). Examples of healthier cooking oils: Canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil. Combinations of these oils may be labeled as “vegetable oils” and are also healthier choices than tropical oils. \\n*   Cooking oils to avoid or use less frequently include the tropical oils coconut oil and palm oil, as well as lard, butter, and shortening. All of these tend to have high amounts of saturated fat, which is associated with increased risk for heart disease. \\n\\nFinally, as a general principle for eating, it is recommended that you: \\n\\n*   Watch the number of calories you eat and drink; cook at home; look for food labels with the Heart-Check to indicate a healthier option; and check nutrition labels for high sodium content. \\n\\n**Recommendation: Lose Weight**\\n\\nIf you are already at a healthy weight, that’s great! Keep up the great work, and be sure to monitor your food intake and exercise activity to continue to maintain a healthy weight. With age, and with changes in life circumstances such as getting married or having kids, many people find that their weight begins to creep up. If your weight is already higher than you would like, consult with your physician or with a reputable source to see what a healthy weight target would be for your height and physical frame. Healthy weight ranges, Body Mass Index ([BMI](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html)), and waist circumference estimators are available online through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html) and the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm). \\n\\nThere are countless books and programs for weight loss, some of which give conflicting advice. It can be difficult to know which recommendations are likely to be most effective. \\n\\nThe following principles are from the American Heart Association, CDC, and NIH. First, goals that are specific, doable (attainable), and forgiving. The NIH offers the following example: \\n\\n*   _“‘Exercise more’ is a great goal, but it's not_ _specific__. \\"Walk 5 miles every day\\" is specific and measurable, but is it doable \\\\[attainable\\\\] if you're just starting out? \\"Walk 30 minutes every day\\" is more attainable, but what happens if you're held up at work one day and there's a thunderstorm during your walking time another day? \\"Walk 30 minutes, 5 days each week\\" is specific, doable, and forgiving. In short, a great goal”._\\n\\nNext, work gradually towards long-term goals by completing a series of shorter-term goals, such as increasing the number of minutes spent exercising each week. As you achieve these goals, the third principle, reward, comes into play. Reward yourself for your successes with a treat (other than food) that you enjoy. This could include giving yourself time off from household obligations or could involve going to a movie. In general, it is better to give yourself smaller, more frequent rewards rather than working weeks or months to earn a large reward. \\n\\nOne of the most important principles in weight loss involves self-monitoring. This generally involves recording (a) what you eat and drink; (b) the amount you exercise; and (c) your weight. The goal is not to track closely in order to punish yourself for eating too much or exercising too little, but simply to develop an accurate, objective estimate of how many calories you are consuming, how many calories you are burning, and the effects on your weight. If you have tendencies to become excessively focused on food, weight, or physical shape, or have a history of an eating disorder such as bulimia or anorexia, then self-monitoring may not be right for you. If you have been diagnosed or treated for an eating disorder, be sure to consult with a behavioral health professional about how best to manage your weight without aggravating the eating disorder. \\n\\nIn general, self-monitoring should provide you with information about what you are eating, when, and how much, so that you can select high calorie foods to reduce, or identify times or activities when you are likely to overeat, such as snacking while watching tv, or staying too long at the table after dinner and continuing to eat when not actually hungry. Keeping at least an estimate of your calorie intake will allow you to compare this number with calories used during exercise. There are a number of online estimators for calories burned for different types of exercise, and some provide inconsistent estimates for the same exercise. However, consulting with two or more online calculators can provide at least an estimate of how many calories you are using each day. If you find that you are consuming more calories than you burn, look at whether you can change this through reducing calories, increasing exercise, or a combination of the two. Although both exercise and reducing calories are important for weight loss, there is some research support for the principle that changes in eating behavior to reduce calories may be more important than exercise. This may be due in part to the amount of time involved; it is far less time-consuming to decline to eat a 500-calorie dessert than spending the hour or so of moderate exercise needed to burn off those 500 calories. \\n\\nGetting your weight into a healthy range can have a significant impact on improving your heart health and will likely make you feel significantly better physically. Additional resources for losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight, are available through the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/prevention.htm), the [NIH](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/wtl_prog.htm), and the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight/keeping-a-healthy-body-weight). \\n\\n**Recommendation: Stop Smoking  \\n**  \\nThe dangers of smoking are well known, as are the difficulties many people face when trying to quit. Studies have shown that the majority of people who attempt to quit smoking relapse within a year and are back to smoking again. However, people who successfully stay quit, and stop smoking for good, tend to (a) learn from past attempts what tripped them up, and what to do differently next time; and (b) KEEP QUITTING! In other words, if they quit smoking but start up again, they begin preparing for their next attempt. By identifying what went wrong in their previous attempt, their plans for their next quitting attempt will include strategies for coping with stressors, such as a hard day at work; or with tempting situations, such as being around people who are smoking. By learning from past mistakes, they can rehearse in advance what they will do next time to respond more effectively. \\n\\nStrategies to quit smoking include replacing times spent smoking with a different enjoyable activity, such as going for a walk, trying a new hobby, going to a movie, or doing yard work. For many people, setting a quit day and committing to it helps make the change more concrete. For many people, quitting “cold turkey” is the most effective method. However, some people will start tapering down on the number of cigarettes per day as they work towards their quit day, with the plan that by quit day they will stop using tobacco altogether. Avoid substituting another type of tobacco product for the one you quit, such as chewing tobacco instead of cigarettes, as all tobacco products have serious harmful health consequences. \\n\\nKeep in mind that most former smokers made several attempts before successfully quitting for good. Estimates of the average number of attempts before success range from a low of 6 attempts, to a high of 30. Regardless of the statistical average, the important principle for you to remember is that continuing to try to quit smoking is the best way to finally become tobacco-free. The benefit to your heart, and many other aspects of your health, will be substantial. \\n\\nAdditional resources for quitting smoking are available from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/smoking-cessation-fast-facts/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftobacco%2Fdata_statistics%2Ffact_sheets%2Fcessation%2Fquitting%2Findex.htm), the [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/i-want-to-quit/top-tips-for-quitting-smoking), the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking-tobacco/5-steps-to-quit-smoking).", "title": "Becoming Heart Healthy", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 16:17:31.628292+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 16:17:31.628292+00	\N	f

The default for most people is the first reaction – deciding who is to blame for the situation. Mental toughness involves taking charge of how one thinks about stress and adversity. Once the negative event is recognized, the mentally tough response includes transitioning from realistic analysis of the situation (cause-oriented thinking) to identifying the most effective steps to take next (response-oriented thinking). Whereas many people naturally spend time pointing fingers and arguing about blame when things go wrong, mentally tough individuals shift their focus forward, looking for what they can fix or enhance, rather than looking backwards for a detailed analysis of why the negative event occurred.\\n\\nSimilarly, rather than using their time and energy in identifying faults in themselves or others that may have caused the problem, they identify actions they can take that will solve the problem or otherwise improve the situation. They recognize the limits of what they are able to do, and do not waste time on problems over which they have no control, nor do they spend mental energy needlessly obsessing over mistakes they may have made, or what they could have done differently. The overriding attitude for mentally tough individuals involves recognizing the facts of the negative situation as they are, without assigning blame; and then focusing on what positive steps can be taken to improve the situation. In addition, they will look for ways that they can mobilize others to contribute to this effort, either through identifying useful actions, or providing appropriate motivation to spur others into effective action.\\n\\nWhile some adverse events are relatively brief, others may last for days, weeks, or longer, and may require prolonged coping. In such situations, maintaining mental toughness can include taking a longer-term view. Visualizing how you would like yourself to be on the other side of a prolonged adverse event can help to prompt actions that will keep you engaging in appropriate and effective behaviors over time, while also helping to lead you to your visualized self once the difficult event has passed.\\n\\nKeeping these strategies in mind can contribute to remaining resilient and mentally tough while facing the daily difficulties that are inherent in public safety work. Practicing these skills, strategies, and way of thinking regularly can serve to solidify them across the years of one’s career, so that they become habits, and mental toughness becomes a way of life.", "title": "Responding to Adversity", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 21:22:47.909358+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:13:36.895038+00	\N	f

There are several behaviors that are helpful in managing stress, and the Cordico app includes many useful articles, spanning important topics such as Stress Management, Healthy Habits, and Sleep Optimization. An overarching, key factor in the healthy management of stress is being proactive, rather than reactive, in the face of pressures and demands. As a law enforcement officer, stress is inevitable, but unpredictable - you will not usually know in advance when major stressors are going to occur on the job. When work becomes the most demanding, and you are most in need of effective stress management strategies, your mental resources will be at their lowest. This makes it more difficult to remember the skills and techniques for coping effectively. By developing good stress management skills from the start, you will be able to take charge of stress, responding effectively rather than becoming overwhelmed when a significant crisis arises at work or at home. \\n\\nGetting regular exercise; maintaining warm, supportive relationships with family and friends; getting adequate sleep; and regularly scheduling enjoyable activities will all help to buffer against the negative effects of stress. In addition, mindfulness practices, including meditation, have been shown to be helpful in improving both emotional and physical health. It is important to build and reinforce strong relationships with your co-workers and also with friends outside of your law enforcement family, so that you have a wide range of supportive people in your life. Maintaining these positive relationships, along with exercise, sufficient sleep, and taking time for enjoyable activities, are low-cost, relatively low-effort practices that can return significant benefits in helping you get ahead of stress and keeping you effective on the job.", "title": "Managing Stress", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:48:51.293146+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:20:00.244808+00	\N	f

Balancing closeness with discipline is a challenge for all parents. And even if parents feel they've finally worked out how to do this, their children continue to grow and change, leading to changes in their interests, and an increasing importance of their friends relative to their parents. Working out how to be connected with your children while maintaining appropriate discipline and boundaries is always a work in progress - and one that is never perfected. Parents are doing well if they can keep their children safe and out of trouble, while continuing to deepen their relationship.\\n\\nRaising children is a challenge no matter what your job is. There are a number of problems that can get in the way of parenting effectively, weaken the relationship between parent and child, and can make children more vulnerable to problem behaviors. Working in law enforcement can create additional challenges to parenting. Working overnight shifts or working extra hours means that you may not see your children very often, and you may be very tired when you do see them. The stressors of the job can stay with you when you head home, and it may be difficult to switch off strong emotions from work right when you get home. First responders are sometimes bothered to find that even though they love their children, they simply don't want to be around them or anyone else for a while after getting home from work (for more about this, see the **Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster** description in the **Emotional Survival** module). And when they are feeling ready to spend time with their children, some first responders find that things don't go the way they hope, they end up feeling irritated, or raising their voice to correct their children rather than enjoying their time together. Any of these things can result in a decreased connection with your children, and growing more and more distant over time.\\n\\nIn this module we start by talking about the importance of letting go of your first responder job when engaging your children. Next, we follow with four sections to help you guide your child's behavior while maintaining a positive relationship. Finally, we end with a full section on the importance of establishing family routines for positive parent-child relationships and your child's development.", "title": "Introduction", "summary": "", "videoUrl": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/452681107", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:31:29.643876+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:25:53.228147+00	\N	f

Parents who don't work in law enforcement are typically not required to take charge of chaotic situations, or to physically subdue dangerous individuals. Law enforcement officers must demonstrate strong command presence on the job, order people to follow their commands, and escalate the intensity of their orders when subjects refuse to comply. These behaviors are essential in law enforcement settings when establishing order and taking control may prevent injury or death.\\n\\nNow imagine the same officer at home with his 8-year-old son, who has been told to turn off his video game after playing too long. The son continues playing the video game. He is told again to turn off the game, and again fails to stop. A clear instruction has been ignored, and if law enforcement training is switched on, the parent officer may follow normal law enforcement principles by forcefully ordering the son to stop, or by physically intervening to take away the video game. While this kind of escalation is necessary while on the job, it can be harmful to the parent-child relationship. It extends beyond the natural authority of the parent over the child, essentially overwhelming the son with verbal or physical intensity. While the officer will likely get the son to comply in this situation, the dynamic is shifted from a parent guiding a child to behave appropriately, to a powerful adult exerting dominance. An important principle for officers who are parents is to make sure to clearly notice and separate the forceful behaviors that are necessary on the job, from the discipline and boundaries that are appropriate in loving parent-child relationships.\\n\\nParenting is challenging even for parents with low-demand careers. The stresses and demands of law enforcement work add to these challenges, and effective parenting is not always intuitive or natural. Considerable research has been conducted to discover what is helpful and what is not helpful in raising children. The following sections describe some of the best-supported and effective parenting practices you can start today. These include giving effective instructions to children, helping children increase useful behaviors, reducing problem behaviors, and developing strong, lasting relationships with your children.", "title": "Switching from Officer to Parent ", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:32:30.416225+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:25:58.227743+00	\N	f

By keeping an eye out all the time for the positive, desirable behaviors that your child is doing, and reinforcing it with praise and attention, you can increase the behaviors that are important for your child's development, while at the same time adding more and more instances of positive experiences and positive emotions linking you and your child. If there is a problem behavior, try to identify what the \\"positive opposite\\" of that behavior is, and reinforce it with praise and attention, and with a point chart if necessary. If you use punishment, time-out from enjoyable activities is the most effective and least risky form of punishment. Time-outs should be brief, and mild; harsher punishments for longer durations do not work better, and usually have negative side effects. The more you can rely on using your praise and attention to shape your kids' behavior, the more likely you will build: a stronger parent-child relationship; a more positive relationship; a more competent child; and, a more self-confident child.\\n\\n**Routines of Family Life**\\n\\nEstablishing routines early with your family promotes stronger and deeper relationships, and will foster your child's emotional and social well-being.

However, they tend to frame these sensations as meaning, \\"I am excited!\\" \\n\\nIf you try to ignore or distract yourself from these physical sensations, you may start to believe that there is something wrong, which can interfere with your performance. However, if you choose to interpret the feelings as meaning, \\"I am energized, I am excited\\", this can shift you from seeing the situation as a threat, and instead viewing it as an opportunity for growth and improvement. \\n\\nKeep in mind that a fear of making mistakes can inhibit people from trying to learn new skills. Shifting your thinking to a growth mindset means focusing on learning and developing, rather than avoiding new experiences so that others won't see you make mistakes. If you combine this growth mindset with choosing to reinterpret sensations in the face of challenges as feelings of excitement, you will be able to pursue new skills and levels of achievement that may have seemed out of reach. \\n\\nOf course, re-framing situations more positively doesn't mean that you should not experience any discomfort when striving for improvement. The authors of Peak Performance describe interviews with elite runners who report that, although they feel pain when running at competitive speeds, they use effective self-talk to manage their response to the pain. Instead of becoming anxious that the pain means that something is wrong, they use calm internal conversation to remind themselves that pain is normal during intense running, and to view the pain as acceptable. This calm conversation with yourself prevents the anxiety spiral that can distract and hinder you when you are in a high-demand situation. Think back to times when you became distracted by discomfort when you were working on a difficult mental task, or training hard physically. Think of what you might try to tell yourself when you face this discomfort in the future. If you can plan in advance to remind yourself that discomfort is acceptable and normal, and that you can tolerate the discomfort while working toward peak performance, you will likely be able to focus more deeply on your training or during demanding work situations. This will allow you to benefit more from each period of training, and to learn more effectively from stressful work situations.", "title": "How to View Stress", "summary": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": ""}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-09-24 20:20:28.02462+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-20 21:29:23.532904+00	\N	f

After you have exerted yourself in training or on the job, be sure to plan for adequate rest. During work shifts, if possible, schedule breaks when you begin to fade mentally or physically, as you will be less effective at such times. A short break of even 5 minutes can be restorative and allow you to return with a higher level of functioning. \\n\\nYou may catch yourself thinking that you shouldn’t take a break – that you have too much to do, and taking a break would cost you time that you could spend working. A good deal of research shows, however, that not just the quality, but even the quantity of work is superior when people take breaks. This is because the efficiency of work improves after periodic breaks – after the break, people have more energy and better focus, and can produce more work in less time.

Make a budget and stick to it.\\n3.  Pay your credit card off completely every month.\\n\\nIf you follow these rules and no others, you will be well on your way to excellent financial fitness. If you ignore these three rules, it will be significantly more difficult to achieve financial fitness. Before moving on to the additional rules, take a minute or two to review these three rules, and think about how well you are following them. If you are following all three, great! If not, consider writing down what is keeping you from doing so, and pick a start date to begin following all three rules. The following sections explain how to do so, and why these rules are so important.\\n\\n1\\\\. \\"Live within your means\\" is a key rule of financial fitness. It entails a strong commitment that you will not spend more than you can afford, so that when there is something that you really want to buy - a car, fishing gear, a trip - you recognize that you will need to take the time to build up your savings before buying it. This requires patience; however, it is well worth waiting a few weeks or months to make a large purchase without going into debt, when compared to the stress and worry that goes along with carrying a balance on a high-interest credit card. More on this later. \\n\\n2\\\\. \\"Make a budget and stick to it\\" is closely related to \\"Living within your means.\\" This involves writing down how much money you make each month, then creating a list of essential expenses (housing, utilities, groceries, insurance), and adding in expenses for optional but enjoyable activities (going out to dinner, travel). As long as your expenses are less than your take home pay, you are living within your means. However, it is easy for new spending to creep in and become a regular expense. For example, going out to eat more frequently than you planned can add up quickly each month. Upgrading to a nicer car, getting premium cable instead of basic, or buying a new smartphone with a high monthly payment can increase monthly expenses by hundreds of dollars, eating away at the monthly paycheck - and potentially consuming more than your paycheck can cover (this is when credit cards can be tempting but dangerous). You can take charge of your financial health with a review of your current monthly expenses by going over bank statements and credit card statements, and identifying and categorizing expenses. You can then prioritize where you want your money to go, identify any expenses that are unnecessary, and make a plan for how you will handle them. This may involve canceling an expensive cable TV package, cutting back on how often you go out to eat, or making more affordable shopping choices. Sticking to a budget doesn't mean that you have to deprive yourself of enjoyment - you can build your favorite activities into your budget by listing these expenses and planning in advance for them. If you know you want season tickets for a team you follow, figure out how much that will cost, how much extra income you have each month, and then calculate how many months it would take to save up the cost of the ticket. The same applies to saving up for a down payment on a car or a house, or saving up for a trip you'd like to take. As long as you plan for it in advance, saving up over time can allow you to afford many things you would like to do, and without the stress of taking on crippling debt. There are many free or low-cost budgeting software programs and smartphone apps. One of the most highly recommended budgeting apps, [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), is available for free. Mint helps you create a personal budget, keeps track of your bills, and will alert you if an upcoming bill has not yet been paid. This app integrates information across your bank accounts and credit cards to provide a comprehensive picture of your financial activities. It even will alert you if you start going over budget. [GoodBudget](https://goodbudget.com/) is a budgeting app that allows couples to manage their budget together, although it can also work for an individual. The basic version of the app is free, while a more advance version currently costs about $5 per month. [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (You Need a Budget) also allows couples to co-budget, and uses an \\"envelope\\" principle, where money is devoted to different expense categories (like a digital version of putting a fixed amount of money in one envelope for groceries, another for utilities, another for rent, and so on). This makes it easy to spot where you may be spending too much, and can help you get back on track if it happens. YNAB is currently about $7 per month.\\n\\n3\\\\. \\"Pay off credit cards every month\\" - the third crucial rule, is also closely related to the first two. As long as you follow the first two rules, you should be able to zero out your credit card payments each month. This is very important, because most credit cards have high interest rates. Although you may not notice it, the interest on unpaid credit card balances can grow so much that you may end up paying more in interest than you do for the original purchases. Here's an example: If you have a credit card balance of $5,000 that you don't pay off, with an interest rate of 14%, there would be $700 in accrued interest in the first year ($5,000 times 14% = $700). And after paying the $700 over the first year (about $59 each month) you would still owe the entire $5,000 balance. Unless you like the idea of sending credit card companies $50, $100, or more each month in interest charges, make it a top priority to pay your credit card balance to zero. Every. Single. Month. If you find that your credit card balance has grown to more than you can pay off in a given month, take a look again at rules 1 and 2 above to ensure that you are living within your means, and that you have a budget that you can follow. Prioritize your spending, and make adjustments as necessary to get yourself living within your means and following your budget.\\n\\nIf you follow rules 1-3 you will likely have some extra money each month. If used wisely, you can grow even modest amounts of extra money each month into enough money to retire early, take trips that you can't afford now, and put your children through college. Believe it or not, saving a million dollars is a very reasonable goal. Almost anyone can save up a million dollars, as long as they have enough time. \\n\\nThe key factors in saving a million dollars are:   \\n\\n1.  How much money you start with \\n2.  What rate of return you earn on the investment \\n3.  How long you have the money invested \\n4.   The next few guidelines focus on how to arrange these factors to maximize your wealth", "title": "Three Core Guidelines", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 13:20:57.794771+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 13:20:57.794771+00	\N	f

This is especially important since law enforcement personnel are at such a higher risk of chronic disease and early death compared to other populations. The purpose of the assessment protocol should be to determine risk of cardiovascular events, diabetes, fitness level and injury risk assessment. At a minimum, the tactical operator should undergo routine blood work as well as a resting and stress EKG. \\n\\n![](https://apps.cordico.com/uploads/images/0/399/798479/heart.jpg)\\n\\nThe stress EKG is not only assessing the health of the heart while exercising, it is also evaluating the cardiovascular fitness of the individual. As mentioned earlier, aerobic fitness is the most important health-related component of physical fitness when it comes to risk of cardiovascular disease. In other words, it is better to be fit and fat, then to be unfit and lean. Many lives of law enforcement personnel have been saved due to the identification of irregular heart rhythms while conducting these assessments.

To determine these claims, the PSOB Office works closely with survivors, injured officers, and agencies to obtain the required documentation to comply with the PSOB law and its implementing regulations. While some claims are straightforward and clearly meet the criteria, others present significant factual and legal complexities that must be resolved before a determination can be made.\\n\\nThe PSOB Office collaborates with national law enforcement, firefighter, and first responder groups to provide a range of PSOB training and technical assistance, from one-to-one mentoring to conferences and online resources.\\n\\n**PSOB BENEFITS**\\n\\n**Death:** PSOB provides a one-time benefit to eligible survivors of public safety officers whose deaths were the direct result of an injury sustained in the line of duty on or after September 29, 1976.\\n\\n**Hometown Heroes:** On December 15, 2003, the Hometown Heroes Survivors’ Benefits Act expanded circumstances under which officer deaths from heart attacks and strokes may be covered by the program.\\n\\nThe Act presumes that the public safety officer who suffered a fatal heart attack, stroke or vascular rupture up to 24 hours after on-duty, non-routine strenuous physical activity or training has died as a result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\\n\\nFor more information on the Hometown Heroes Survivors’ Act, go to [www.psob.gov](http://www.psob.gov).\\n\\n**Disability:** PSOB provides a one-time benefit to eligible public safety officers who were permanently and totally disabled as a result of a catastrophic injury sustained in the line of duty on or after November 29, 1990.

3d033c66-0bc6-4647-ab99-707cae482eeb	Corr - Financial Fitness - Additional Guidelines	810a0667-8ab5-4568-ae7b-0da80a1932eb	{"body": "## Additional Guidelines\\n\\n\\nInvest for the future (savings, retirement, college for children) as early as you can, and contribute every month, even if the amounts are small.\\n\\nWhile it can be easy to think that you should wait until later to start thinking about retirement or other investments, the sooner you start regularly putting away even small amounts of money into a savings or investment account, the larger these returns will grow over time. If you wait until you have a large amount of money to invest, you will lose out on one of the most important variables in investing: time. Even small amounts of money invested can grow to a million dollars, given enough time. Take a look at this graph below comparing an officer who began investing $500 per month at age 25, with one who began investing at age 35. This graph shows how much they both will have at age 50, assuming an average rate of return of 9% per year. Starting earlier made a huge difference in this case – $553,943 for the officer who started at age 25, compared with $192,020 for the officer who started 10 years later.\\n\\n\\n\\n![](https://apps.apptology.com/uploads/images/0/388/777879/Graph1.png)\\n\\n**Start Early!**\\n\\nIt doesn’t take much to set up an investment account (although it is important to spend some time to make sure your account involves low-cost investment options and does not take a large management fee). Once you have an investment account set up, set up an automatic withdrawal plan so that money is moved into your investment account without needing to remember to do so. Your bank also likely has an option to automatically transfer a monthly amount for your paycheck deposit into a dedicated savings account. Both of these options can help you grow your wealth with a minimum of effort.\\n\\n**Rate of Return on Investment**\\n\\nFinancial experts recommend that you have cash savings that equal 3-6 months of salary, and that you build up savings in cash or other stable assets (like Treasury bills) for expenses that you expect to have in the next 3-5 years. For example, if you are planning to put a $5,000 down payment on a house in six months, the $5,000 should be in cash. Although cash savings earns almost no interest, it is very stable. In comparison, stocks have the potential to earn much higher rates of return, but they also can drop significantly in value. For this reason, you should invest in stocks and similar assets only after you have enough savings in cash to cover immediate and near-term expenses.\\n\\nAt the same time, if you leave all of your assets in cash, or in low-risk, low-return assets like Treasury bills, bonds, or certificates of deposit (CDs), they will grow very little over time, because the rate of return is so low. For this reason, it is recommended that your long-term investments include a significant amount of stocks (also called equities). For the best long-term gains, the easiest path is to invest primarily in low-fee Stock Index Funds. Stock index funds on average earn much larger returns than stable, but low-return assets like cash, treasury bills, CDs, or bonds. Although the value of stocks can fluctuate significantly, losing 10-15% some years, gaining 15-25% some years, over the past 100 years the average annual rate of return on the S&P 500 Index has been about 10%.\\n\\nThis higher rate of return is important because of compound growth. At 10%, $1,000 becomes $1,100 after a year ($1000 x .10 = $100, which is added to the original $1,000). The $1,100 then becomes $1,210 at the end of year two, which becomes $1,331 after year three, and so on. By year eight it has grown to $2,144 – more than double the original amount.\\n\\nThe graph below illustrates the importance of rate of return on investment. Here we see two individuals investing $500 per month, starting at the same time, and investing for 25 years. The only difference is that one is invested in primarily stocks, and earns an average 9% rate of return, while the other earns an average 3% rate of return by investing only in low-risk, low-return assets like bonds and CDs. Over 25 years the difference in accumulated wealth is striking – $553,943 compared to $225,318.\\n![](https://apps.apptology.com/uploads/images/0/388/777879/Graph2.png)  \\n\\nAlthough there are many options for low-expense index funds, Vanguard has been a leader in establishing index funds across a range of sectors. Easy choices would include their [S&P 500 Index fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFINX), which tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a composite of many large U.S. companies.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that index funds are such a great idea is that they are very low cost because they do not pay an expensive fund manager to make all sorts of decisions about which stocks to invest in, when to sell them, and so on. And even though they keep costs low by simply investing in the companies that make up the S&P 500 Index, the performance of index funds beats the performance of (more expensive) actively managed funds more than 70% of the time. It’s rare that you can get better performance at a low cost, but index funds are one case where this has been shown to be true year after year.\\n\\nWhen you are many years from retirement, investment primarily in stock-based mutual funds. Be sure to diversify, because this means that if one sector of the economy (like tech or energy) has a slump, you will still own stock in other sectors. In addition, diversify across regions. Your investments should include US stocks (like an S&P 500 Index Fund) but also stocks outside of the US (International or Global funds, excluding US stocks, such as Vanguard FTSE All-World excluding-US Index Fund Admiral (VFWAX)). It is also useful to include small- and mid-sized companies, and so you can further diversify by including Small-Cap (smaller companies) and Mid-Cap (medium-sized companies) Index funds. Examples include the [Fidelity Small-Cap Index Fund (FSSNX)](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146182), and the [Fidelity Spartan Mid Cap Index Fund (FSMDX)](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146265).\\n\\nThe remainder of your portfolio should include more stable assets including bond funds, inflation-protected US Treasuries, as well as REITs (real-estate investment trusts). These allow for further diversification and protect against large market slumps.\\n\\nIdeally, some or most of your investment should be in a tax-advantaged retirement account such as an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). (Note that anything you want to use at a younger age should not be placed in an IRA or 401k, as there are penalties for early withdrawal). Most agencies will have some sort of retirement plan set up, and so this will certainly be an important part of your overall investments. But you can also make additional contributions to an IRA, which can result in significant tax savings, because the amount that you contribute to a regular IRA will not be subject to tax in the year that you make the contribution.\\n\\nFunds that you invest in an IRA separately from the retirement benefits that your employer offers will increase your total savings at retirement. If should be noted that under current IRS rules you cannot withdraw IRA funds before age 59 ½ without having to pay a penalty. However, whatever amount you can invest into an IRA will make your retirement all the sweeter and more secure. You can also invest in non-IRA investment accounts, and you would have access to these funds whenever you like.\\n\\n**Amount Invested: Contribute as Much as Possible**\\n\\nThe examples above have assumed a monthly investment of $500 per month. Depending on your situation, you may be able to invest more or less than $500 per month. Whatever the amount, investing early and regularly can result in very large returns over time. However, the more you are able to invest each month, the greater your returns. The graph below compares the amount accumulated at age 50, with both individuals starting at age 25 and both earning 9% average annual returns. The bar on the left shows returns when $500/month is invested, compared to returns for $100/month on the right. Investing $100 each month results in $110,788, which is a great outcome with relatively little effort. But notice that stretching to invest $500 each month makes a very large difference at age 50, totaling $553,943. (Remember that these amounts are hypothetical and based on average returns; actual investment returns may be higher or lower, depending on many factors).  \\n\\n![](https://apps.apptology.com/uploads/images/0/388/777879/Graph3.png)", "title": "Additional Guidelines", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 13:25:51.331429+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 13:25:51.331429+00	\N	f

Providing information about what is known about the event that happened, what efforts are underway to help, where and when they can access needed services, and how to cope with their emotional responses can help the survivors to respond more effectively. For some survivors, a brief and simple discussion of how people tend to react emotionally and physically to traumatic events can normalize their experience and help them make sense of their responses. Physical reactions to traumatic events can include stomachache, headache, racing heart, and hyperventilation. It is also common to experience increased anxiety and watchfulness, withdrawal from activities; and intrusive reactions, such as repeated images of the event, or distressing dreams about what happened. There are a number of helpful coping responses you can recommend to survivors that can help them manage the effects of the traumatic event. These can include talking to someone for support, and setting aside times for positive events, such as reading, or playing a sport. You can also encourage the survivor to be kind to himself or herself, and to not criticize themselves for the different kinds of emotional responses they may be experiencing. Setting a regular routine, including exercise as well as pleasurable activities, helps to restore predictability and enjoyment.

Trying to explain away such events as \\"mistakes\\" is ineffective when someone chose, for whatever reason, to do something that they knew was wrong. \\n\\nIf someone in a position of authority did something morally wrong, and this has been burdening you with anger, contempt, or cynicism, it can be useful to simply acknowledge the fact that this event occurred, and to accept this reality. This does not mean that you agree with the action, or dismiss it or say \\"no big deal.\\" Instead, this involves accepting the reality that, in the world we live in, people at times do things that are morally wrong. This acceptance can be helpful because some people will brood and stew over a perceived wrong, as if the sense of injustice would eat at them until the moral wrong was made right. Acknowledging and accepting this \\"someone in authority did something morally wrong, and it cannot be undone\\" can allow the toxic feelings of anger and contempt over the injustice to fade away. \\n\\nThe same applies if you have been distressed by something that you did that violated your moral values; acknowledging and accepting the reality that you did something against your moral values causes you to make the reality an explicit part of history. Some people struggle daily with guilt and shame, and try in one way or another to \\"undo\\" the moral violation, sometimes by punishing themselves or cutting themselves off from others. While these actions create misery for the person and their loved ones, they cannot undo the moral violation itself. By acknowledging and accepting the reality of having violated your moral values, you can move towards forgiving yourself as a person who did something they regret. \\n\\nIn fact, an important part of healing from moral injury involves accepting the reality that moral violations being committed by oneself and by others makes up a part (although usually a very small part) of being human. Languages around the world incorporate a term for \\"forgiveness\\" precisely because humans, at one time or another, commit acts that they should not have committed. Fortunately, our stories do not stop when we do something wrong, and we all have the potential to move forward from moral injuries. How does one move forward after an act that causes moral injury?

The phrase, “an eye for an eye” captures this notion. However, it may not be within your power to address a moral violation by another, or to persuade them to make amends for their actions. Making a decision to forgive the person for the actions that violated moral codes, can allow you to come to terms with the event, and to let go of the toxic emotions of anger and contempt that may have been affecting you. Keep in mind that forgiveness can take many forms, and it is not always practical, legally advisable, or wise to outwardly proclaim forgiveness – and that is okay. Forgiveness can be a private process in which you make the firm decision to let go and move on from something that cannot be changed, thereby granting yourself the freedom to proceed with your life without, being further encumbered by unalterable past events.", "title": "Forgiving Others", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 15:53:45.350398+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 15:53:45.350398+00	\N	f

Now recognize some of the ways that an unresolved moral injury may have interfered with living these values the ways that you would like. Make a commitment to yourself that you will try each day to live out these values, even though you did something wrong in the past; even though someone in authority violated important moral values. You can accept the reality of the past moral failure without allowing it to define you, or to determine the path that the rest of your life will take.

The default for most people is the first reaction – deciding who is to blame for the situation. Mental toughness involves taking charge of how one thinks about stress and adversity. Once the negative event is recognized, the mentally tough response includes transitioning from realistic analysis of the situation (cause-oriented thinking) to identifying the most effective steps to take next (response-oriented thinking). Whereas many people naturally spend time pointing fingers and arguing about blame when things go wrong, mentally tough individuals shift their focus forward, looking for what they can fix or enhance, rather than looking backwards for a detailed analysis of why the negative event occurred.\\n\\nSimilarly, rather than using their time and energy in identifying faults in themselves or others that may have caused the problem, they identify actions they can take that will solve the problem or otherwise improve the situation. They recognize the limits of what they are able to do, and do not waste time on problems over which they have no control, nor do they spend mental energy needlessly obsessing over mistakes they may have made, or what they could have done differently. The overriding attitude for mentally tough individuals involves recognizing the facts of the negative situation as they are, without assigning blame; and then focusing on what positive steps can be taken to improve the situation. In addition, they will look for ways that they can mobilize others to contribute to this effort, either through identifying useful actions, or providing appropriate motivation to spur others into effective action.\\n\\nWhile some adverse events are relatively brief, others may last for days, weeks, or longer, and may require prolonged coping. In such situations, maintaining mental toughness can include taking a longer-term view. Visualizing how you would like yourself to be on the other side of a prolonged adverse event can help to prompt actions that will keep you engaging in appropriate and effective behaviors over time, while also helping to lead you to your visualized self once the difficult event has passed.\\n\\nKeeping these strategies in mind can contribute to remaining resilient and mentally tough while facing the daily difficulties that are inherent in public safety work. Practicing these skills, strategies, and way of thinking regularly can serve to solidify them across the years of one’s career, so that they become habits, and mental toughness becomes a way of life.", "title": "", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 16:47:10.650291+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 16:47:10.650291+00	\N	f

However, it is very important to approach financial matters with a level-headed and clear-eyed approach. There are all too many tales of new officers who find themselves with high credit card debt, and little or no savings.

It can also lead to years of worrying about finances, contributing to family conflict and a lower quality of life overall.\\n\\nYou can start off and on right foot by making a financial plan, starting with your very first paycheck. You'll need to store some money in a savings account, as a cushion for unexpected expenses. Many experts recommend building up the equivalent of 3-6 months of salary in a savings account. It's also important to avoid the attraction of low-interest introductory offers on credit cards. If you buy expensive items on credit cards, the interest rates soon go up to 10%, 15%, or even higher, costing potentially hundreds of dollars each month in interest payments. Instead, do your best to save up for items that you can't afford right away.

Balancing closeness with discipline is a challenge for all parents. And even if parents feel they've finally worked out how to do this, their children continue to grow and change, leading to changes in their interests, and an increasing importance of their friends relative to their parents. Working out how to be connected with your children while maintaining appropriate discipline and boundaries is always a work in progress - and one that is never perfected. Parents are doing well if they can keep their children safe and out of trouble, while continuing to deepen their relationship.\\n\\nRaising children is a challenge no matter what your job is. There are a number of problems that can get in the way of parenting effectively, weaken the relationship between parent and child, and can make children more vulnerable to problem behaviors. Working as a correctional officer can create additional challenges to parenting. Working overnight shifts or working extra hours means that you may not see your children very often, and you may be very tired when you do see them. The stressors of the job can stay with you when you head home, and it may be difficult to switch off strong emotions from work right when you get home. Correctional officers and correctional staff are sometimes bothered to find that even though they love their children, they simply don't want to be around them or anyone else for a while after getting home from work (for more about this, see the Hypervigilance Biological Roller Coaster description in the Emotional Survival module). And when they are feeling ready to spend time with their children, some correctional officers and correctional staff find that things don't go the way they hope, they end up feeling irritated, or raising their voice to correct their children rather than enjoying their time together. Any of these things can result in a decreased connection with your children, and growing more and more distant over time.\\n\\nIn this module we start by talking about the importance of letting go of your correctional job when engaging your children. Next, we follow with four sections to help you guide your child's behavior while maintaining a positive relationship. Finally, we end with a full section on the importance of establishing family routines for positive parent-child relationships and your child's development.", "title": "Introduction", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:08:05.681219+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:08:05.681219+00	\N	f

Parents who don’t work in correctional facilities are typically not required to take charge of chaotic situations, or to physically subdue dangerous inmates. Correctional officers and correctional staff must demonstrate strong command presence on the job, order inmates to follow their commands, and escalate the intensity of their orders when inmates refuse to comply. These behaviors are essential in correctional settings when establishing order and taking control may prevent injury or death.\\n\\nNow imagine the same correctional officer or correctional staff at home with their 8-year-old son, who has been told to turn off his video game after playing too long. The son continues playing the video game. He is told again to turn off the game, and again fails to stop. A clear instruction has been ignored, and if training is switched on, the parent correctional officer/staff may follow normal correctional principles by forcefully ordering the son to stop, or by physically intervening to take away the video game. While this kind of escalation is necessary while on the job, it can be harmful to the parent-child relationship. It extends beyond the natural authority of the parent over the child, essentially overwhelming the son with verbal or physical intensity. While the correctional officer or correctional staff will likely get the son to comply in this situation, the dynamic is shifted from a parent guiding a child to behave appropriately, to a powerful adult exerting dominance. An important principle for officers and staff who are parents is to make sure to clearly notice and separate the forceful behaviors that are necessary on the job, from the discipline and boundaries that are appropriate in loving parent-child relationships.\\n\\nParenting is challenging even for parents with non-correctional careers. The stresses and demands of correctional work add to these challenges, and effective parenting is not always intuitive or natural. Considerable research has been conducted to discover what is helpful and what is not helpful in raising children. The following sections describe some of the best-supported and effective parenting practices you can start today. These include giving effective instructions to children, helping children increase useful behaviors, reducing problem behaviors, and developing strong, lasting relationships with your children.", "title": "Switching from Correctional Officer or Correctional Staff to Parent ", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:09:39.152282+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:09:39.152282+00	\N	f

By keeping an eye out all the time for the positive, desirable behaviors that your child is doing, and reinforcing it with praise and attention, you can increase the behaviors that are important for your child's development, while at the same time adding more and more instances of positive experiences and positive emotions linking you and your child. If there is a problem behavior, try to identify what the \\"positive opposite\\" of that behavior is, and reinforce it with praise and attention, and with a point chart if necessary. If you use punishment, time-out from enjoyable activities is the most effective and least risky form of punishment. Time-outs should be brief, and mild; harsher punishments for longer durations do not work better, and usually have negative side effects. The more you can rely on using your praise and attention to shape your kids' behavior, the more likely you will build: a stronger parent-child relationship; a more positive relationship; a more competent child; and, a more self-confident child.\\n\\n**Routines of Family Life**\\n\\nEstablishing routines early with your family promotes stronger and deeper relationships, and will foster your child's emotional and social well-being.

However, children who engage in more positive social behaviors are also more likely to do well in school, and to avoid behaviors that would get them into trouble. As a result, researchers are emphasizing the importance of developing positive social behaviors as preparation for succeeding in school, and later on in careers.

Reinforcing their practice of these behaviors will help strengthen them; making them more likely to continue to occur, and helping the child turn behaviors into regular habits.\\n\\nYour child will often show a combination of positive and negative behaviors in the same situation.

To clarify what is meant by “listening,” I will quote Dr. Kazdin directly: “If you’re waiting for your child to stop talking so you can correct her misconceptions, that’s a pretty good definition of not listening.” Try simply taking in what your child is communicating, noticing what their experience is like. Set aside the impulse to correct or challenge what your child says – there is plenty of time for that – and simply listen to what the world looks like through their eyes.

Some of the material in this article is drawn from Alan Kazdin's book, [_The Everyday Parenting Toolkit_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544227824/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3). Alan Kazdin is one of the leading experts in parenting research, and the strategies he uses have been shown to be effective in numerous research studies. At 177 pages, _The Everyday Parenting Toolkit_ is an easy parenting resource to read.

Following routines must be balanced with a good dose of flexibility. Rigidly adhering to a routine at all costs, rather than bending the routine to allow for special circumstances, can introduce more tension. When trying to establish guidelines for positive family life, it is important to seek a \\"just right\\" balance between flexibility and boundaries. While it is important to establish and maintain high standards for your children's behavior, it is also valuable for deepening your relationship that you listen attentively to your child's perspective, and include this input in family decisions. Particularly for issues that will not be harmful, it can be helpful to compromise and allow requests that you may not prefer (e.g., dyed hair). Doing so gives more credibility and authority when you take a strong position on issues that involve long-term negative consequences (such as teen smoking).", "title": "Balance Consistency with Flexibility", "media_type": "text", "body_mime_type": "text/markdown"}	df1aa970-8f04-449a-8501-0bd9ffa84a45	2021-10-29 17:34:12.205209+00	0ea3a790-ba7e-4429-a7e4-6e7f5f9000a0	2021-10-29 17:34:12.205209+00	\N	f

The Law Enforcement Chaplaincy Sacramento (LECS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, charitable organization committed to serving law enforcement personnel and their families, victims of crime and tragedies, and the community at large. LECS is the only service of its kind that provides 24-7-365 rapid response teams alongside law enforcement agencies with on-scene emotional crisis support. Chaplains are experts in the aftermath of grief and loss. LECS serves 19 different law enforcement agencies, 16 local school districts, State and County government agencies, customer based retail businesses and various churches throughout the region. LECS provides families with immediate practical guidance, and valuable resources of what happens next, after their loss.  To what kinds of incidents does LECS respond? LECS responds to a wide variety of critical incidents, including serious accidents, suicides, homicides or suspicious deaths, sudden infant deaths, barricaded subjects, missing persons, industrial accidents, unexpected natural deaths, death notifications, and many others. Typically, we are deployed by law enforcement dispatchers within moments of officers’ arrival on scene. Prevention programs, intervention services and aftermath post-vention services complement the first responder calls within the Sacramento community.  What makes LECS Chaplains different? The Law Enforcement Chaplaincy Sacramento (LECS) has been named “The Model Chaplaincy In the Nation” because of its exceptional organizational structure, its extensive training requirements, and its rapid response capability. LECS Chaplains Academy, which is accredited through the Los Rios Community College, consists of 150-hours of academic classroom and field service training. All LECS Chaplains are background tested, pass two-oral interviews and must agree to continuing educational requirements and mandatory group monthly trainings. Further, LECS Chaplains are Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) certified post-trauma and crisis responders. Chaplains are trained in the areas of crime scene integrity, psychological first aid, school crisis intervention, mass casualty evacuation scene support, search and rescue field operations, Town Hall meeting strategies, and Family Assistance Centers’ management. Since 1977, LECS has been supported by individual donations, corporate sponsors, churches, and departments through small contract service grants.

As far as a law enforcement career, I can say I've done it all. I worked my way from Patrol Officer all the way up to Chief of Police. I have been an Instructor, Recruiter, FTO, Honor Guard, Bike Patrol, and was the longest serving LPD officer of the Boone Co. Special Response Team with over 17 years on the Team. I've experienced all the positives of this career...the good we do, promotions, recognition, the people we help, the elation of serving with law enforcement family, the lives we have saved. I have also experienced all the bad that this career can bring...debilitating on duty injuries, two officer involved shootings, suspensions, depression, demotion, divorce, the death of friends. Through it all I had faith that I would always make it through. If you are having trouble, chances are I've been there before. I am here to give advice, to help in any way I can, or just to simply listen as a friend.   During my off time, I enjoy working out, and spending time with the love of my life, my wife, Pam.

In the end, we create one team where every person contributes and every person matters. This job changes us in positive and negative ways. Dealing with people on their worst day, all day long, sets a different standard of “normal” that may be hard to cope with especially when transitioning to home life. I just want my peers to know that I care. Our peer support team cares. We want to hear about your frustrations, complaints and joys in life on and off the job. We all need it!  I’m a firm believer of working hard but playing harder. I have to stay fit to keep up with my three kids and extremely active husband. Unfortunately, my physique is greatly hindered by my love of dark chocolate with almonds and hazelnuts. I don’t have any free time but most of my time outside of work is spent with my family and friends (there are a lot of parties), working out, and doing Tahitian dance.
